CYLLENIAN Hermes summoned forth the souls 
Of the slain suitors. In his hand he bore 
The beautiful golden wand, with which at will 



Book XXIV. 233 

He shuts the eyes of men, or opens them 

From sleep. With this he guided on their way s 

The ghostly rout ; they followed, uttering 

A shrilly wail. As when a flock of bats, 

Deep in a dismal cavern, fly about 

And squeak, if one have fallen from the place 

Where, clinging to each other and the rock, 10 

They rested, so that crowd of ghosts went forth 

With shrill and plaintive cries. Before them moved 

Beneficent Hermes through those dreary ways, 

And past the ocean stream they went, and past 

Leucadia's rock, the portals of the Sun, 15 

And people of the land of dreams, until 

They reached the fields of asphodel, where dwell 

The souls, the bodiless forms of those who die. 

And there they found the soul of Peleus' son, 
His friend Patroclus, and the blameless chief 
Antilochus, and Ajax, who excelled 
In stature and in form all other Greeks 
Save the great son of Peleus. These were grouped 
Around Achilles. Then approached the ghost 
Of Agamemnon, Atreus' son ; he seemed ^ 

In sorrow, and around him others stood, 
Who in the palace of ^Egisthus met 
Their fate and died. The son of Peleus took 
The word, and spake to Agamemnon thus : — 

" Atrides, we had thought that Jove, who wields 30 
The thunder, favored thee, through all thy years, 
Beyond all other men, — thou didst bear rule 



234 The Odyssey. 

Over so many and such valiant men 

Upon the plain of Troy, where we of Greece 

Endured such sufferings. Yet all too soon 35 

The cruel doom of death, which no man born 

Of woman can escape, has fallen on thee. 

O, if amid the honors of thy sway 

That doom had overtaken thee, while yet 

In Troy's far realm, then would the assembled 

Greeks 40 

Have built a tomb to thee ! Thou wouldst have left 
A heritage of glory to thy son \ 
Now hast thou died a most unhappy death." 

And then the soul of Agamemnon said : 
" Fortunate son of Peleus, godlike chief « 

Achilles, who didst die upon the field 
Of Ilium, far from Argos, while there fell 
Around thee many of the bravest sons 
Of Troy and Greece, who fought for thee, and 

thou 
Wert lying in thy mighty bulk, amid 50 

Whirlwinds of dust, forgetful evermore 
Of horsemanship. All that day long we fought, 
Nor stayed our hands till Jove, to part us, sent 
A hurricane. When we had borne thee thence 
And brought thee to the fleet, upon a bier 55 

We laid thee, pouring o'er thy shapely limbs 
Warm water, and anointing them with oil. 
Round thee the Achaians stood in tears, hot tears, 
And cut their hair away. From ocean's depth 



Book XXIV. 235 

Thy mother, when she heard the tidings, rose &o 
With her immortal sea-nymphs. Mournfully 
Came o'er the waves the sound of their lament. 
Trembled the Greeks with fear, and, rushing forth, 
Would have sought refuge in their roomy ships, 
If Nestor, wise in ancient lore, and known 65 

For counsels ever safe, had not restrained 
Their haste, and thus declared his prudent 

thought : — 
" ' Stay, Argives, youths of Greece ; think not of 

flight ! 
It is his mother ; from the sea she comes eg 

To her dead son, and brings her deathless nymphs.' 
" He spake ; his words withheld the valiant 

Greeks 
From flight. And now around thee came and stood 
The daughters of the Ancient of the Deep, 
Lamenting bitterly. Upon thy corse 
They put ambrosial robes. The Muses nine 75 

Bewailed thee with sweet voices, answering 
Each other. Then wouldst thou have seen no one 
Of all the Argive host with eyes unwet, 
The Muses' song so moved them. Seventeen day? 
And nights we mourned thee, — both the immortal 

ones & 

And mortals. On the eighteenth day we gave 
Thy body to the fire, and at the pile 
Slew many fatling ewes, and many an ox 
With crooked horns. In raiment of the gods 



2$$ The Odyssey. 

The fire consumed thee 'midst anointing oils 
And honey. Many heroes of our host 
In armor and in chariots, or on foot, 
Contended round thy funeral pyre in games, 
And mighty was the din. And when at length 
The fires of Vulcan had consumed thy flesh, 
We gathered up at morning thy white bones, 
Achilles, pouring over them pure wine 
And fragrant oils. Thy mother brought a vase 
Of gold, which Bacchus gave, she said, the work 
Of Vulcan the renowned, and in it now, 
Illustrious son of Peleus, thy white bones 
Are lying, and with thine are mingled those 
Of dead Patroclus Mencetiades. 
Apart we placed the ashes of thy friend 
Antilochus, whom thou didst honor most 
After the slain Patroclus. O'er all these 
The sacred army of the warlike Greeks 
Built up a tomb magnificently vast 
Upon a cape of the broad Hellespont, 
There to be seen, far off upon the deep, 
By those who now are born, or shall be born 
In future years. Thy mother, having first 
Prayed to the gods, appointed noble games, 
Within the circus, for the Achaian chiefs. 
Full often have I seen the funeral rites 
Of heroes, when the youth, their chieftain dead, 
Were girded for the games, and strove to win 
The prizes ; but I most of all admired 



Book XXIV. 237 

Those which the silver-footed Thetis gave 

To mark thy burial, who wert loved by all 115 

The immortals. So thou hast not lost by death 

Thy fame, Achilles, and among the tribes 

Of men thy glory will be ever great ; 

But what hath it availed me to have brought 

The war on Ilium to an end, since Jove i*> 

Doomed me to be destroyed on my return, 

Slain by ^Egisthus and my guilty wife ? " 

So talked they with each other. Now approached 
The herald Argus-queller, bringing down 
The souls of suitors by Ulysses slain. 12s 

Both chiefs moved toward them, wondering at the 

sight. 
The soul of Agamemnon, Atreus' son, 
Knew well-renowned Amphimedon, whose birth 
Was from Melanthius, and by whom he once 
Was welcomed to his house in Ithaca ; 130 

And him the son of Atreus first bespake : — 

" Amphimedon, what sad mischance has brought 
You all, who seem like chosen men, and all 
Of equal age, into these drear abodes 
Beneath the earth ? T were hard indeed to find, 135 
In a whole city, nobler forms of men. 
Has Neptune wrecked you in your ships at sea 
With fierce winds and huge waves, or armed men 
Smitten you on the land, while carrying off 
Their beeves and sheep, or fighting to defend %i% 
Your wives and city? Tell me, for I claim 



238 The Odyssey. 

To have been once your guest. Rememberest thou 
I lodged in thy own palace when I came 
With godlike Menelaus, and besought 
Ulysses to unite his gallant fleet 145 

To ours, and sail for Troy. A whole month long 
Were we in crossing the wide sea, and hard 
We found the task to gain as our ally 
Ulysses, the destroyer of walled towns." 

The soul of dead Amphimedon replied : 150 

" Atrides Agamemnon, far renowned, 
And king of men, I well remember all 
Of which thou speakest \ I will now relate, 
And truly, how we met our evil end. 
We wooed the wife of the long-absent chief 153 

Ulysses ; she rejected not nor yet 
Granted our suit, detested as it was, 
But, meditating our destruction, planned 
This shrewd device. She laid upon the loom 
Within her rooms a web of delicate threads, 160 

Ample in length and breadth, and thus she said 
To all of us : ' Young princes, who are come 
To woo me, — since Ulysses is no more, 
My noble husband, — urge me not, I pray, 
To marriage, till I finish in the loom — »<* 

That so my threads may not be spun in vain — 
A funeral vesture for the hero-chief 
Laertes, when his fatal hour shall come, 
With death's long sleep * else some Achaian dame 
Might blame me, should I leave without a shroud 170 



Book XXIV. 23$ 

Him who in life possessed such ample wealth/ 
Such were her words, and easily they won 
Upon our generous minds. So went she on 
Weaving that ample web, and every night 
Unravelled it by torchlight. Three full years 175 
She practised thus, and by the fraud deceived 
The Grecian youths ; but when the hours had 

brought 
The fourth year round, a woman who knew all 
Revealed the mystery, and we ourselves 
Saw her unravelling the ample web. *&> 

Thenceforth constrained, and with unwilling hands, 
She finished it. And when at length she showed 
The vesture she had woven, the broad web 
That she had bleached to brightness like the sun's 
Or like the moon's, some hostile deity 185 

Brought back Ulysses to a distant nook 
Of his own fields, and to his swineherd's lodge. 
And thither also came in his black ship 
His son, returning from the sandy coast 
Of Pylos. Thence the twain, when they had planned 
To slay the suitors, came within the walls 191 

Of the great city ; first Telemachus, 
And after him Ulysses, with his guide 
The swineherd. He was clad in sordid weeds, 
And seemed a wretched beggar, very old, 19s 

Propped on a staff. In that disguise of rags 
None knew him, as he suddenly appeared, 
Not even the oldest of us all. Harsh words 



240 The Odyssey. 

And blows we gave him. He endured them all 

Awhile with patience, smitten and reviled *rf 

In his own palace. Moved at length by Jove, 

He and his son Telemachus bore off 

The shining weapons from the hall, to lie 

In a far chamber, and barred all the doors. 

Then, prompted by her husband's craft, the queen 

Proposed a game of archery, with bow 2d 

And rings of hoary steel, to all of us 

Ill-fated suitors. This drew on our death. 

Not one of us could bend that sturdy bow, 

None had the strength. But as it passed from us «« 

Into Ulysses' hands, we loudly chid 

The bearer, and forbade him, but in vain. 

Telemachus alone with stern command 

Bade him deliver it. When in his hands 

The much-enduring chief, Ulysses, took fc« 

The bow, he drew the string with ease, and sent 

A shaft through all the rings. He sprang and stood 

Upon the threshold ; at his feet he poured 

The winged arrows, cast a terrible glance 

Around him, and laid King Antinoiis dead, ** 

Then sent the fatal shafts at those who stood 

Before him ; side by side they fell and died. 

Some god, we saw, was with them, as they rushed 

Upon us mightily, and chased us through 

The palace, slaying us on every side ; ** 

And fearful were the groans of dying men, 

As skulls were cloven, and the pavement swam 



Book XXIV. 241 

With blood. Such, Agamemnon, was the fate 
By which we perished. Now our bodies lie 
Neglected at the palace ; for not yet 23* 

Our kindred, dwelling in our homes, have heard 
The tidings, nor have come to cleanse our wounds 
From the dark blood, and lay us on the bier 
With tears, — such honors as are due the dead." 

In turn the soul of Agamemnon spake : 23s 

" Son of Laertes, fortunate and wise, 
Ulysses! thou by feats of eminent might 
And valor dost possess thy wife again. 
And nobly minded is thy blameless queen, 
The daughter of Icarius, faithfully 240 

Remembering him to whom she gave her troth 
AVhile yet a virgin. Never shall the fame 
Of his great valor perish, and the gods 
Themselves shall frame, for those who dwell on 

earth, 
Sweet strains in praise of sage Penelope. 24s 

Not such was she who treacherously slew 
The husband of her youth, — she of the house 
Of Tyndarus. Her name among mankind 
Shall be the hateful burden of a song ; 
And great is the dishonor it has brought 250 

On women, even the faithful and the good." 

So talked they with each other, standing there 
In Pluto's realm beneath the vaulted earth. 
Meantime Ulysses, hastening from the town, 
Came to the fair fields of Laertes, tilled »ss 

. VOL. II. II P 



242 The Odyssey. 

With care. Laertes, after years of toil, 

Acquired them. There his dwelling stood ; a shed 

Encircled it, where ate and sat and slept 

The servants of the household, who fulfilled 

His slightest wish. An old Sicilian dame *» 

Was there, who waited, in that distant spot, 

On her old master with assiduous care. 

And then Ulysses to his followers said : — 

" Go into that fair dwelling, and with speed 
Slay for our feast the fattest of the swine. 265 

I go to prove my father ; I would learn 
Whether he knows me when he sees my face, 
Or haply knows me not, so long away." 

He spake, and laid his weapons in their hands. 
Straight toward the house they went. Ulysses 
passed 270 

Into the fruitful orchard, there to prove 
His father. Going down and far within 
The garden-plot, he found not Dolius there, 
Nor any of the servants, nor his sons. 
All were abroad, old Dolius leading them. 27s 

They gathered thorns to fence the garden-grounds. 
There, delving in that fertile spot, around 
A newly planted tree, Ulysses saw 
His father only, sordidly arrayed 
In a coarse tunic, patched and soiled. He wore 28 
Patched greaves of bullock's hide upon his thighs, 
A fence against the thorns ; and on his hands 
gloves, to protect them from the prickly stems 



Book XXIV. 243 

Of bramble ; and upon his head a cap 

Of goatskin. There he brooded o'er his grief. 285 

Him when the much-enduring chief beheld, 

Wasted with age and sorrow-worn, he stopped 

Beside a lofty pear-tree's stem and wept, 

And pondered whether he should kiss and clasp 

His father in his arms, and tell him all, wo 

How he had reached his native land and home, 

Or question first and prove him. Musing thus, 

It pleased him to begin with sportive words ; 

And thus resolved, divine Ulysses drew 

Near to his father stooping at his task, «9s 

And loosening the hard earth about a tree, 

And thus the illustrious son accosted him : — 

" O aged man ! there is no lack of skill 
In tending this fair orchard, which thy care 
Keeps flourishing ; no growth is there of fig, 300 
Vine, pear, or olive, or of plants that grow 
In borders, that has missed thy friendly hand. 
Yet let me say, and be thou not displeased, 
Thou art ill cared for, burdened as thou art 
With years, and squalid, and in mean attire. 303 

It cannot be that for thy idleness 
Thy master treats thee thus ; nor is there seen 
Aught servile in thy aspect, — in thy face 
Or stature ; thou art rather like a king ; 
Thou seemest one who should enjoy the bath m 
And banquet, and lie soft, — for this befits 
Old men like thee. Now say, and tell me true, 



244 The Odyssey. 

Who may thy master be ? whose orchard this 
Which thou dost tend ? And, more than this, de- 
clare, 
For much I long to know, if I am come 315 

To Ithaca, as I just now was told 
By one who met me as I came, — a man 
Not overwise, who would not stop to tell 
What I desired to learn, nor bear to hear 
My questions, when I asked him if a guest 320 

Of mine were living yet in health, or dead 
And in the realm of Pluto. Let me speak 
Of him, and mark me well, I pray ; I lodged 
Once, in my native land, a man who came 
Into my house, and never stranger yet 32s 

More welcome was than he. He was by birth 
Of Ithaca, he said, Laertes' son, 
And grandson of Arcesias. Him I led 
Beneath my roof, and hospitably lodged, 
And feasted in the plenty of my home, 330 

And gave such gifts as might become a host, — 
Seven talents of wrought gold, a silver cup 
All over rough with flowers, twelve single cloaks, 
Twelve mats, twelve mantles passing beautiful, 
And tunics twelve, and, chosen by himself, 335 

Twelve graceful damsels, skilled in household arts." 

And then his father answered, shedding tears : 
" Thou art indeed, O stranger, in the land 
Of which thou dost inquire, but wicked men 
And lawless now possess it. Thou hast given 34a 



Book XXIV. 245 

Thy generous gifts in vain • yet hadst thou found 

Ulysses living yet in Ithaca, 

Then would he have dismissed thee recompensed 

With gifts and liberal cheer, as is the due 

Of him who once has been our host. Yet say, 345 

And truly say, how many years have passed 

Since thou didst lodge my son, if he it was, 

Thy hapless guest, whom, far away from home 

And all his friends, the creatures of the deep, 

And the foul birds of air, and beasts of prey, 350 

Already have devoured. No mother mourned 

His death and wrapped him in his shroud, nor I, 

His father ; nor did chaste Penelope, 

His consort nobly dowered, bewail the man 

She loved upon his bier with eyes dissolved 355 

In tears, as fitting was, — an honor due 

To those who die. Now, further, truly tell, 

For I would learn, what is thy name, and whence 

Thou comest, from what tribe, thy city where, 

And who thy parents. Where is the good ship 360 

At anchor which has brought thee and thy friends ? 

Or hast thou landed from another's bark, 

Which put thee on the shore and left the isle ? " 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" I will tell all and truly. I am come 36? 

From Alybas ; a stately dwelling there 
Is mine, Apheidas is my father, son 
Of royal Polypemon, and my name 
Eperitus. Some deity has warped 



246 The Odyssey. 

My course astray from the Sicanian coast, 37* 

And brought me hithe.'ward against my will. 

My bark lies yonder, stationed by the field 

Far from the city. This is the fifth year 

Since parting with me thy Ulysses left 

My native land for his, ill-fated man ! 37s 

Yet there were flights of birds upon the right 

Of happy presage as he sailed, and I 

Dismissed him cheerfully, and cheerfully 

He went. We hoped that we might yet become 

Each other's guests, exchanging princely gifts." 3&> 

He spake, and a dark cloud of sorrow came 
Over Laertes. With both hands he grasped 
The yellow dust, and over his white head 
Shed it with piteous groans. Ulysses felt 
His heart within him melted ; the hot breath 385 
Rushed through his nostrils as he looked upon 
His well-beloved father, and he sprang 
And kissed and clasped him in his arms, and said : — 

" Nay, I am he, my father ; I myself 
Am he of whom thou askest. I am come 390 

To mine own country in the twentieth year. 
But calm thyself, refrain from tears, and grieve 
No more, and let me tell thee, in a word, 
I have slain all the suitors in my halls, 
And so avenged their insolence and crimes." 39s 

And then Laertes spake again, and said : 
u If now thou be Ulysses, my lost son, 
Give some plain token, that I may believe." 



Book XXIV. 247 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" First, then, behold with thine own eyes the scar ** 
Which once the white tusk of a forest boar 
Inflicted on Parnassus, when I made 
The journey thither, by thy own command, 
And by my gracious mother's, to receive 
Gifts which her father, King Autolycus, ♦* 

Once promised, when he came to Ithaca. 
And listen to me further ; let me name 
The trees which in thy well-tilled orchard grounds 
Thou gavest me ; I asked them all of thee, 
When by thy side I trod the garden walks, 4to 

A little boy. We went among the trees, 
And thou didst name them. Of the pear thirteen, 
And of the apple ten thou gavest me, 
And forty fig-trees ; and thou didst engage 
To give me fifty rows of vines, each row 415 

Of growth to feed the winepress. Grapes are there 
Of every flavor when the hours of Jove 
Shall nurse them into ripeness from on high." 

He spake ; a trembling seized the old man's heart 
And knees, as he perceived how true were all 420 
The tokens which Ulysses gave. He threw 
Round his dear son his arms. The hardy chief, 
Ulysses, drew him fainting to his heart. 
But when the old man's strength revived, and calm 
Came o'er his spirit, thus he spake again : — 425 

" O father Jove, assuredly the gods 
Dwell on the Olympian height, since we behold 



248 l^he Odyssey. 

The arrogant suitors punished for their crimes. 
Yet much I fear lest all the Ithacans 
Throng hither, and send messages to rouse 430 

Against us all the Cephallenian states." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" Take courage ; let no thought like that disturb 
Thy mind ; but let us hasten to the house. 
Telemachus is there, with whom I sent 43s 

The herdsman and the swineherd, bidding them 
Make ready with all speed our evening meal." 

Thus talked the twain, and toward the dwelling took 
Their way, and entering the commodious rooms 
They found Telemachus, and by his side 44° 

The herdsman and the keeper of the swine, 
Dividing for the feast the plenteous meats, 
And mingling the dark wine. Then to the bath 
Came the Sicilian dame, and ministered 
To the large-souled Laertes, and with oil 445 

Anointed him, and wrapped a sumptuous cloak 
About him. Pallas gave the monarch's limbs 
A.n ampler roundness ; taller to the sight 
He stood, and statelier. As he left the bath, 
His. son beheld with wonder in his eyes, 450 

So like a god Laertes seemed, and thus 
Ulysses said to him in winged words : — 

" Some one among the ever-living gods 
Llath surely shed, O father, on thy form 
And aspect all this grace and majesty." 455 

The sage Laertes answered : " Father Jove, 



Book XXIV. 249 

And Pallas and Apollo ! would that I 

Were now as when I took the citadel 

Of Nericus, the strongly built, beside 

The sea-shore of Epirus, leading on 4& 

My Cephallenians ! With such strength as then, 

Armed for the fray, I would have met and fought 

The suitors in the palace yesterday, 

And struck down many lifeless in the hall, 

And greatly would thy spirit have rejoiced." 465 

So talked they with each other. When they all 
Ceased from their task, and saw their meal prepared, 
They sat them down in order on the thrones 
And seats, and each put forth his hand and shared 
The banquet Now approached an aged man, 470 
Dolius, attended by his sons, who came 
Weary with toil, for the Sicilian dame, 
The nurse who reared them, went and summoned 

them, — 
She who in his late age with faithful care 
Cherished the father. These, when at the board 47s 
They saw Ulysses, and knew who he was, 
Stopped in the hall astonished. Instantly 
Ulysses called to them with friendly words : — 

" Sit at the board, old man ; let none of you 
Give way to blank amazement. Know that we, 480 
Though keen our appetite for this repast, 
Have waited long, expecting your return." 

He spake, and Dolius sprang with outstretched 
arms 

11* 



250 The Odyssey. 

And seized Ulysses by the hand, and kissed 

The wrist; and thus in winged words he spake: — 

" Dear master ! since thou art returned to us, 486 
Who longed and yet expected not to see 
Thy face again, — since some divinity 
Has led thee hither, — hail ! and great may be 
Thy happiness, and may the gods bestow ao» 

All blessings on thee ! But declare, for I 
Would gladly know, if sage Penelope 
Have heard the tidings yet of thy return, 
Or must we send them by a messenger." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 495 

" My aged friend, she knows already all. 
Why wouldst thou take' that care upon thyself ? " 

He spake, and Dolius on a polished seat 
Sat down, but round the great Ulysses came 
His sons, and welcomed him with loving words, s«> 
And hung upon his hand, and then they took 
Their places by their father. So they sat 
Beneath Laertes' roof, and banqueted. 

Now through the city meantime swiftly ran 
The rumor that the suitors all had met 505 

A bloody death. No sooner had men heard 
The tidings than they came with cries and moans 
Before the palace, moving to and fro. 
Each carried forth his dead, and gave to each 
His funeral rites, except to those who came s»» 

From distant cities ; these they put on board 
Swift-sailing galleys of the fishermen, 



Book XXIV. 251 

That they might bear them home. And then they 

came 
Sorrowing together in the market-place. 
There, when the assembly now was full, arose 515 
Eupeithes and addressed them. In his heart 
Was sorrow, that could never be consoled, 
For his slain son Antinoiis, who was first 
To fall before Ulysses. Weeping rose 
The father, and harangued the assembly thus : — 
" Great things, indeed, my friends, hath this man 

done 521 

For us Achaians. Many valiant men 
He gathered in his ships and led abroad, 
And lost his gallant ships, and lost his men ■ 
And now, returning, he has put to death 52s 

The best of all the Cephallenian race. 
Come, then, and ere he find a safe retreat 
In Pylos, or in hallowed Elis, where 
The Epeians rule, pursue him ; endless shame 
Will be our portion else, and they who live 530 

In future years will hear of our disgrace. 
If we avenge not on these men of blood 
The murder of our sons and brothers, life 
Will not be sweet to me, and I would go 
A-t once, and gladly, down among the dead. 533 

Rise, then, and fall upon them ere they flee." 
So spake he, weeping ; and the Greeks were 

moved 
With pity as they heard him. Now appeared 



252 The Odyssey. 

The herald Medon and the sacred bard, 

As, rising from the sleep of night, they left 5* 

The palace of Ulysses. They stood forth 

Amid the multitude, who all beheld 

With wonder. Then sagacious Medon spake : — 

" Give ear, ye men of Ithaca, and know 
That not without the approval of the gods 545 

Ulysses hath done this. I saw, myself, 
One of the immortals taking part with him, 
In all things like to Mentor. Now the god 
Standing before Ulysses strengthened him 
For combat, and now drove the routed band 550 
Of suitors through the hall ; in heaps they fell." 

He spake, and all who heard were pale with fear. 
The aged hero, Halitherses, son 
Of Mastor, then came forward; he alone 
Knew what was past and what was yet to come, sss 
And, wisely judging, to the assembly said : — 

" Hear now my words, ye men of Ithaca. 
Through your own wrong all this has come to pass. 
To me ye would not hearken, nor obey 
When Mentor, shepherd of the people, spake. 560 
On the mad doings of your sons ye put 
No curb, nor checked the guilty insolence 
That dared to waste the substance and insult 
The consort of a man of eminent worth, 
Who, so they thought, would nevermore return. 5^ 
Now be it as I counsel ; let us not 
Go forth to draw down evil on our heads." 



Book XXIV. 253 

He spake ; but more than half the assembly 
rushed 
Abroad with shouts ; the others kept their place 
Together. Ill the augur's speech had pleased 570 
The most. Eupeithes had persuaded them. 
They flew to arms, and when they had put on 
The glittering brass, they mustered in close ranks 
Before the spacious city. At their head 
Eupeithes led them on, who madly deemed 575 

Himself the avenger of his slaughtered son. 
Yet he from that encounter nevermore 
Was to return ; his fate o'ertook him there. 

Then Pallas thus addressed Saturnian Jove: 
" Our Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, 5&> 

Tell me, I pray, the purpose of thy heart 
Yet unrevealed. Shall there be cruel war 
And deadly combats, or wilt thou ordain 
That these shall henceforth dwell in amity ? " 

And cloud-compelling Jove made answer thus : 58s 
" My child, why ask me ? Was it not with thee 
A cherished purpose, that, returning home, 
Ulysses amply should avenge himself 
Upon the suitors ? Do, then, as thou wilt. 
Yet this, as the most fitting, I advise. s<» 

Now that the great Ulysses has avenged 
His wrongs, let there be made a faithful league 
With oaths, and let Ulysses ever reign ; 
And we will cause the living to forget 
Their sons and brothers slain, and all shall dwell 59s 



254 The Odyssey. 

In friendship as they heretofore have dwelt, 
And there shall be prosperity and peace." 

He spake, and eager as she was before, 
Encouraged by his words, the goddess plunged 
Down from the summits of the Olympian mount &• 
Now when they all had feasted to the full, 
The much-enduring chief, Ulysses, said : 
" Go, one of you, and see if they are near." 

He spake ; a son of Dolius at his word 
Went forth, and, coming to the threshold, stopped. 6o S 
He saw them all at hand, and instantly 
Bespake Ulysses thus, with winged words : 
" They are upon us ; we must arm at once." 

He spake ; they rose, and quickly were in arms. 
Four were Ulysses and his friends, and six 610 

The sons of Dolius. Old Laertes then, 
And Dolius, put on armor with the rest, 
Gray-headed as they were, for now their aid 
Was needed. When they all had clad themselves 
In shining brass, they threw the portals wide- 6i 5 
And sallied forth, Ulysses at their head. 

Now Pallas, daughter of almighty Jove, 
Drew near them. She had taken Mentor's form 
And Mentor's voice. The much-enduring chief, 
Ulysses, saw her and rejoiced, and said 6*> 

To his beloved son, Telemachus : — 

" Now wilt thou, of thyself, Telemachus, 
Bethink thee, when thou minglest in the fray 
That tries men's valor, not to cast disgrace 



Book XXIV. 255 

Upon thy forefathers, — a race renowned 625 

For manly daring over all the earth." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 
" Nay, if thou wilt, my father, thou shalt see 
That by no lack of valor shall I cast, 
As thou hast said, dishonor on thy race." 630 

Laertes heard them, and rejoiced, and said: 
" O what a day for me, ye blessed gods, 
Is this ! With what delight I see my son 
And grandson rivals on the battle-field." 

And then the blue-eyed Pallas, drawing near 6 3S 
Laertes, said : " Son of Arcesias, loved 
By me beyond all others of my friends, 
Pray to Jove's blue-eyed daughter, and to Jove, 
And brandish thy long spear, and send it forth." 

So Pallas spake, and breathed into his frame <ho 
Strength irresistible. The aged chief 
Prayed to the daughter of almighty Jove, 
And brandished his long spear and sent it forth. 
It smote Eupeithes on the helmet's cheek. 
The brass stayed not the spear, the blade passed 
through, 645 

And heavily Eupeithes fell to earth, 
His armor clashing round him as he fell. 
Then rushed Ulysses and his valiant son 
Forward, the foremost of their band, and smote 
Their foes with swords and lancet double-edged, 6*. 
And would have struck them down to rise no more, 
If Pallas, daughter of the god who bears 



256 The Odyssey. 

The aegis, had not with a mighty voice 
Commanded all the combatants to cease : — 

" Stay, men of Ithaca ; withhold your hands && 
From deadly combat. Part, and shed no blood." 

So Pallas spake, and they grew pale with awe, 
And fear-struck ; as they heard her words they 

dropped 
Their weapons all upon the earth. They fled 
Townward as if for life, while terribly 660 

The much-enduring chief Ulysses raised 
His voice, and shouted after them, and sprang 
Upon them as an eagle darts through air. 
Then Saturn's son sent down a bolt of fire ; 
It fell before his blue-eyed daughter's feet, 66 S 

And thus the goddess to Ulysses called : — 

"Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise, 
Ulysses, hold thy hand ; restrain the rage 
Of deadly combat, lest the god who wields 
The thunder, Saturn's son, be wroth with thee." 670 

She spake, and gladly he obeyed; and then 
Pallas, the child of aegis-bearing Jove, 
Plighted, in Mentor's form with Mentor's voice, 
A covenant of peace between the foes.
