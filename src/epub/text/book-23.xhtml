UP to the royal bower the matron went 
With an exulting heart, to tell the queen 
That her beloved husband was within. 



Book XXIII. 217 

With knees that faltered not, and quick light step 
She went, and, standing by her mistress, said : — 5 

" Awake, Penelope, dear child, and see 
With thine own eyes what thou hast pined for long. 
Ulysses has returned ; thy lord is here, 
Though late, and he has slain the arrogant crew 
Of suitors, who disgraced his house, and made » 
His wealth a spoil, and dared insult his son." 

And thus discreet Penelope replied : 
" The gods, dear nurse, have made thee mad ; for 

they 
Have power to change the wisest men to fools, 
And make the foolish wise, and they have warped r S 
Thy mind once sound. How canst thou mock me 

thus, 
Amidst my sorrows, with such idle tales? 
Why wake me from the pleasant sleep that closed 
My lids so softly ? Never have I slept 
So sweetly since Ulysses went from me *> 

To that bad city, which no tongue should name. 
Go, then ; return into the lower rooms. 
Had any of my women save thyself 
Brought such a message to disturb my sleep, 
I would have sent her back into the hall *s 

With angry words ; thy years are thy excuse." 

But Eurycleia, the dear nurse, rejoined : 
" Nay, my dear child, I mock thee not. Most true 
It is that thy Ulysses has returned, 
And here he is at home, as I have said. ■* 



218 The Odyssey. 

The stranger whom they scoffed at in the hall 

Is he ; and long Telemachus has known 

That he was here, but wisely kept from all 

His father's secret, till he should avenge 

Upon those violent men their guilty deeds." ■* 

She ended, and her mistress, overjoyed, 
Sprang from her couch, embraced the aged dame, 
And wept, and said to her in winged words : — 

" Tell me, dear nurse, and truly, if indeed 
Ulysses have returned as thou hast said. 4 

How smote he those proud suitors ? — he alone, 
And they so many, gathered in the hall." 

And thus the well-beloved nurse replied : 
" I saw it not, nor knew of it. I heard 
Only the moanings of the slain, while we * 

The maids, affrighted, sat in a recess 
Of that well-vaulted chamber ; the firm doors 
Closed us all in, until at length thy son, 
Sent by his father, called me forth. I found 
Ulysses standing midst the dead that lay a 

Heaped on each other, everywhere along 
The solid pavement. Thou wouldst have rejoiced 
To see him like a lion with the stains 
Of slaughter on him. Now the suitors lie 
Before the portals of the palace-court, s 

And he has kindled a great fire, and steeps 
In smoke the noble hall. He bade me come 
To call thee. Follow me, that ye may give 
Your hearts to gladness, — for ye have endured 



Book XXIII. 219 

Great sorrows both, and your long-cherished hope 60 

Is now fulfilled. He hath returned alive 

To his dear home, and finds thee and his son 

Yet in his palace, and hath terribly 

Avenged himself upon the guilty men 

Who under his own roof have done him wrong." 6s 

Then spake the sage Penelope again : 
" Beloved nurse, exult not overmuch, 
Nor rashly boast. Well is it known to thee, 
Were he to come beneath this roof again, 
How welcome he would be to all, but most 70 

To me and to the son to whom we gave 
His being. Yet thy tidings are not true. 
Some one of the immortals must have slain 
The arrogant suitors, angry to behold 
Their foul injustice and their many crimes ; 75 

For no respect had they to mortal man, 
Good he might be, or bad, whome'er they met ; 
And therefore have they made an evil end. 
But my Ulysses must have perished far 
From Ithaca, cut off from his return." so 

Then Eurycleia, the dear nurse, rejoined : 
" What words are these, my child, that pass thy lips ? 
Sayst thou, then, that thy husband, who now stands 
Upon thy hearthstone, never will return ? 
O slow of faith ! but thou wert ever thus. 85 

Come, then, I give a certain proof. I saw 
Myself, when he was at the bath, the scar 
Left on him by the white tusk of a boar, 



220 The Odyssey. 

And would have told thee, but he laid his hands 
Upon my mouth, and would not suffer me 90 

To bear the tidings, such his forecast was. 
Now follow me ; I give my life in pledge. 
If I deceive thee, slay me ruthlessly." 

Then spake discreet Penelope again : 
" Dear nurse, though thou in many things art wise, 9s 
Think not to scan the counsels of the gods, 
Who live forever. Yet will we descend, 
And meet my son, and look upon the slain, 
And see the avenger by whose hand they fell." 

She spake, and from the royal bower went down, «x> 
Uncertain whether she should stand aloof 
And question there her lord, or haste to him 
And clasp his hands in hers and kiss his brow. 
But having passed the threshold of hewn stone, 
Entering she took her seat right opposite »s 

Ulysses, in the full glow of the fire, 
Against the other wall. Ulysses sat 
Beside a lofty column with his eyes 
Cast down, and waiting for his high-born wife 
To speak when she had seen him. Long she sat "o 
In silence, for amazement overpowered 
Her senses. Sometimes, looking in his eyes, 
She saw her husband there, and then again, 
Clad in those sordid weeds, she knew him not. 
Then spake Telemachus, and chid her thus : — "5 

" Mother, unfeeling mother ! hard of heart 
Art thou ; how else couldst thou remain aloof? 



Book XXI I L 221 

How keep from taking, at my father's side, 
Thy place, to talk with him, and question him ? 
No other wife could bring herself to bear r» 

Such distance from a husband, just returned 
After long hardships, in the twentieth year 
Of absence, to his native land and her. 
Mother ! thy heart is harder than a stone." 

And thus the sage Penelope replied : **$ 

" Dear child, my faculties are overpowered 
With wonder, and I cannot question him, 
Nor even speak to him, nor fix my looks 
Upon his face. But if it be indeed 
Ulysses, and he have returned, we soon 130 

Shall know each other ; there are tokens known 
To both of us, to none but him and me." 

She ended, and the much-enduring chief 
Ulysses, smiling at her words, bespake 
Telemachus at once, in winged words : — ■ 13s 

" Suffer thy mother, O Telemachus, 
To prove me ; she will know me better soon. 
My looks are sordid, and my limbs are wrapped 
In tattered raiment, therefore does she think 
Meanly of me, and cannot willingly 14* 

Believe that I am he. But let us now 
Consider what most wisely may be done. 
He who hath slain, among a tribe of men, 
A single one with few to avenge his death, 
Flees from his kindred and his native land ; 145 

But we have slain the champions of the realm, 



222 The Odyssey. 

The flower of all the youth of Ithaca. 

Therefore, I pray thee, think what shall be done." 

And then disoreet Telemachus replied : 
" Look thou to that, dear father ; for they say 15* 
That thou of all mankind wert wont to give 
The wisest counsels. None of mortal birth 
In this was deemed thy peer. We follow thee 
With cheerful hearts ; nor will our courage fail, 
I think, in aught that lies within our power." tss 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" Then will I tell thee what I deem most wise. 
First take the bath, and then array yourselves 
In tunics, bid the palace-maidens choose 
Fresh garments ; let the godlike bard, who bears r&» 
The clear-toned harp, be leader, and strike up 
A melody to prompt the festive dance, 
That all may say who hear it from without, — 
Whether the passers by or dwellers near, — 
' It is a wedding.' Else throughout the land 165 

The rumor of the slaughter we have wrought 
Among the suitors may have spread before 
We reach our wooded farm, and there consult 
Beneath the guidance of Olympian Jove." 

He spake ; they hearkened and obeyed. They took 
The bath, and then they put their garments on. 17* 
The maids arrayed themselves ; the godlike bard 
Took the curved harp, and woke in all the love 
Of melody, and of the graceful dance. 
The spacious pile resounded to the steps *?j 



Book XXIIL 223 

Of men and shapely women in their mirth, 

And one who stood without was heard to say : — 

" Some one, no doubt, has made the long-wooed 
queen 
His bride at last ; a worthless woman she, 
Who could not, for the husband of her youth, ia> 
Keep his fair palace till he came again." 

Such words were said, but they who uttered them 
Knew little what had passed. Eurynome, 
The matron of the palace, meantime took 
Magnanimous Ulysses to the bath 185 

In his own dwelling, smoothed his limbs with oil, 
And threw a gorgeous mantle over him 
And tunic. Pallas on the hero's head 
Shed grace and majesty ; she made him seem 
Taller and statelier, made his locks flow down 1** 
In curls like blossoms of the hyacinth, 
As when a workman skilled in many arts, 
And taught by Pallas and Minerva, twines 
A golden border round the silver mass, 
A glorious work ; so did the goddess shed *x? 

Grace o'er his face and form. So from the bath 
He stepped, like one of the immortals, took 
The seat from which he rose, right opposite 
Penelope, and thus addressed the queen : — 

K Lady, the dwellers of the Olympian heights •? 
Have given thee an impenetrable heart 
Beyond all other women. Sure I am 
No other wife could bring herself to bear 



224 The Odyssey. 

Such distance from a husband just returned 
After long hardships, in the twentieth year *« 

Of absence, to his native land and her. 
Come, nurse, prepare a bed, where by myself 
I may lie down ; an iron heart is hers." 

To this the sage Penelope replied : 
" Nay, sir, 't is not through pride or disregard, «» 
Or through excess of wonder, that I act 
Thus toward thee. Well do I remember thee 
As thou wert in the day when thy good ship 
Bore thee from Ithaca. Bestir thyself, 
Dame Eurycleia, and make up with care **s 

A bed without the chamber, which he framed 
With his own hands ; bear out the massive bed, 
And lay upon it seemly coverings, 
Fleeces and mantles for his nightly rest." 

She spake to try her husband ; but, displeased, 220 
Ulysses answered thus his virtuous queen : — 

" O woman, thou hast said unwelcome words- 
Who hath displaced my bed ? That task were hard 
For long-experienced hands, unless some god 
Had come to shift its place. No living man, ^s 
Even in his prime of years, could easily 
Have moved it, for in that elaborate work 
There was a mystery ; it was I myself 
Who shaped it, no one else. Within my court 
There grew an olive-tree with full-leaved boughs, 2?« 
A tall and flourishing tree ; its massive stem 
Was like a column. Round it I built up 



Book XXIII. 225 

A chamber with cemented stones until 

The walls were finished ; then I framed a roof 

Above it, and put on the well-glued doors 235 

Close fitting. Next I lopped the full-leaved boughs, 

And, cutting off the trunk above the root, 

Smoothed well the stump with tools, and made of it 

A post to bear the couch. I bored the wood 

With wimbles, placed on it the frame, and carved 240 

The work till it was done, inlaying it 

With silver, gold, and ivory. I stretched 

Upon it thongs of oxhide brightly dyed 

In purple. Now, O wife, I cannot know 

Whether my bed remains as then it was, 24s 

Or whether some one from the root has hewn 

The olive trunk, and moved it from its place." 

He spake, and her knees faltered and her heart 
Was melted as she heard her lord recount 
The tokens all so truly ; and she wept, 25° 

And rose, and ran to him, and flung her arms 
About his neck, and kissed his brow, and said : — 

" Ulysses, look not on me angrily, 
Thou who in other things art wise above 
All other men. The gods have made our lot 25s 
A hard one, jealous lest we should have passed 
Our youth together happily, and thus 
Have reached old age. I pray, be not incensed, 
Nor take it ill that I embraced thee not 
As soon as I beheld thee, for my heart •* 

Has ever trembled lest some one who comes 
10* o 



226 The Odyssey. 

Into this isle should cozen me with words ; 

And they who practise fraud are numberless. 

The Argive Helen, child of Jupiter, 

Would ne'er have listened to a stranger's suit *s 

And loved him, had she known that in the years 

To come the warlike Greeks would bring her back 

To her own land. It was a deity 

Who prompted her to that foul wrong. Her thought 

Was never of the great calamity 270 

Which followed, and which brought such woe on us. 

But now, since thou, by tokens clear and true, 

Hast spoken of our bed, which human eye 

Has never seen save mine and thine, and those 

Of one handmaiden only, Actoris, — 275 

Her whom my father gave me when I came 

To this thy palace, and who kept the door 

Of our close chamber, — thou hast won my mind 

To full belief, though hard it was to win." 

She spake, and he was moved to tears ; he wept 
As in his arms he held his dearly loved '*** 

And faithful wife. As welcome as the land 
To those who swim the deep, of whose stout bark 
Neptune has made a wreck amidst the waves, 
Tossed by the billow and the blast, and few 28s 

Are those who from the hoary ocean reach 
The shore, their limbs all crested with the brine, 
These gladly climb the sea-beach, and are safe, — 
So welcome was her husband to her eyes. 
Nor would her fair white arms release his neck, . *>• 



Book XXIII. 227 

And there would rosy-fingered Morn have found 
Both weeping, but the blue-eyed Pallas planned 
That thus it should not be ; she stayed the night 
When near its close, and held the golden Morn 
Long in the ocean deeps, nor suffered her 295 

To yoke her steeds that bring the light to men, — 
Lampas and Phaethon, swift steeds that bear 
The Morning on her way. Ulysses then, 
The man of forecast, thus bespake his queen : — 

" Not yet, O wife, have we attained the close 3~ 
Of all our labors. One remains which yet 
I must achieve, toilsome, and measureless 
In difficulty ; for so prophesied 
The spirit of Tiresias, on the day 
When to the abode of Pluto I went down 305 

To ask the seer concerning the return 
Of my companions, and my own. But now 
Seek we our couch, dear wife, that, softly laid, 
We may refresh ourselves with welcome sleep." 

Then spake in turn the sage Penelope : i» 

" Whenever thou desirest it thy couch 
Shall be made ready, since the gods vouchsafe 
To bring thee back into thy pleasant home 
And to thy native land. But now that thou 
Hast spoken of it, and some deity 31s 

Is prompting thee, declare what this new task 
May be. Hereafter I shall hear of it, 
No doubt, nor were it worse to know it now." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 



228 The Odyssey. 

" Dear wife, why wilt thou ask ? why press me thus ? 

Yet will I tell thee truly, nor will keep 32s 

Aught from thee, though thou wilt not gladly hear, 

Nor I relate. Tiresias bade me pass 

Through city after city, till I found 

A people who know not the sea, nor eat v 

Their food with salt, who never yet beheld 

The red-prowed galley, nor the shapely oars, 

Which are the wings of ships. And this plain sign 

He gave, nor will I keep it back from thee, 

That when another traveller whom I meet 330 

Shall say it is a winnowing-fan I bear 

On my stout shoulder, there he bade me plant 

The oar upright in earth, and offer up 

To monarch Neptune there a ram, a bull, 

And sturdy boar, and then, returning home, 33s 

Burn hallowed hecatombs to all the gods 

Who dwell in the broad heaven, each one in turn. 

At last will death come over me, afar 

From ocean, such a death as peacefully 

Shall take me off in a serene old age, 340 

Amid a people prosperous and content 

Allthis, the prophet said, will come to pass." 

And then the sage Penelope rejoined : 
" If thus the immortals make thy later age 
The happier, there is hope that thou wilt find 34s 
Escape from evil in the years to come." 

So talked they with each other. Meantime went 
Eurynome, attended by the nurse, 



Book XXIII. 229 

And in the light of blazing torches dressed 

With soft fresh drapery a bed ; and when 35° 

Their busy hands had made it full and high, 

The aged dame withdrew to take her rest 

In her own chamber, while Eurynome, 

Who kept the royal bower, upheld a torch 

And thither led the pair, and, when they both 355 

Were in the chamber, went her way. They took 

Their place delighted in the ancient bed. 

The prince, the herdsman, and the swineherd ceased 

Meantime to tread the dance, and bade the maids 

Cease also, and within the palace-rooms 360 

Dark with night's shadow, sought their place of rest. 

Then came the time of pleasant mutual talk, 

In which that noblest among women spake 

Of wrongs endured beneath her roof from those 

Who came to woo her, — an insatiate crew, — 36s 

Who made of beeves and fatlings of the flock 

Large slaughter, and drained many a wine-cask dry. 

Then nobly born Ulysses told what woes 

His valor brought on other men ; what toils 

And suffering he had borne ; he told her all, 379 

And she, delighted, heard him, nor did sleep 

Light on her eyelids till his tale was done. 

And first he told her how he overcame 
The people of Ciconia ; how he passed 
Thence to the rich fields of the race who feed 37s 
Upon the lotus ; what the Cyclops did, 
And how upon the Cyclops he avenged 



230 The Odyssey. 

The death of his brave comrades, whom the wretch 
Had piteously slaughtered and devoured. 
And how he came to ^Eolus, and found 380 

A friendly welcome, and was sent by him 
Upon his voyage ; yet 't was not his fate 
To reach his native land ; a tempest caught 
His fleet, and far across the fishy deep 
Bore him away, lamenting bitterly. 38s 

And how he landed at Telepylus, 
Among the Laestrigonians, who destroyed 
His ships and warlike comrades, he alone 
In his black ship escaping. Then he told 
Of Circe, her deceit and many arts, 390 

And how he went to Pluto's dismal realm 
In his good galley, to consult the soul 
Of him of Thebes, Tiresias, and beheld 
All his lost comrades and his mother, — her 
Who brought him forth, and trained him when a 
child. 395 

And how he heard the Sirens afterward, 
And how he came upon the wandering rocks, 
The terrible Charybdis, and the crags 
Of Scylla, — which no man had ever passed 
In safety ; how his comrades slew for food #» 

The oxen of the Sun ; how Jupiter, 
The Thunderer, with a bolt of fire from heaven 
Smote his swift bark ; and how his gallant crew 
All perished, he alone escaped with life. 
And how he reached Ogygia's isle, he told, 4qs 



Book XXIII. 231 

And met the nymph Calypso, who desired 

That he would be her husband, and long time 

Detained and fed him in her vaulted grot, 

And promised that he ne'er should die, nor know 

Decay of age, through all the days to come ; w 

Yet moved she not the purpose of his heart. 

And how he next through many hardships came 

To the Phasacians, and they welcomed him 

And honored him as if he were a god, 

And to his native country in a bark 41s 

Sent him with ample gifts of brass and gold 

And raiment. As he uttered this last word, 

Sleep softly overcame him ; all his limbs 

Lay loose in rest, and all his cares were calmed. 

The blue-eyed Pallas had yet new designs ; 420 
And when she deemed Ulysses was refreshed 
With rest and sleep, in that accustomed bed, 
She called the Morning, daughter of the Dawn, 
To rise from ocean in her car of gold, 
And shed her light on men. Ulysses rose 425 

From his soft couch, and thus enjoined his spouse : — 

" O wife ! enough of misery have we borne 
Already, — thou in weeping for my long 
Unhappy absence, — I for years withheld 
By Jupiter and all the other gods 0° 

From my return to this dear land, although 
I pined for home. Now since upon this couch 
We take the place so earnestly desired, 
Take thou the charge of all that I possess 



232 The Odyssey. 

Here in the palace. For the herds and flocks 435 

Which those high-handed suitors have devoured, 

I shall seize many others as a spoil ; 

The rest the Greeks will bring me, till my stalls 

Are filled again. I hasten to my farm 

Embowered in trees, to greet the aged man 44» 

My excellent father, who continually 

Grieves for me. Prudent as thou art, I give 

This charge ; a rumor, with the rising sun, 

Will quickly go abroad that I have slain 

The suitors in the palace. Now withdraw, 445 

Thou and thy maidens, to the upper room, 

And sit and look not forth, nor ask of aught." 

So spake the chief, and on his shoulders braced 
His glorious armor. Then he called his son, 
The herdsman, and the swineherd, bidding them 450 
To take in hand their weapons. They obeyed, 
And, having armed themselves in brass, they threw 
The portals open. As they all went forth, 
Ulysses led the way. The early light 
Was on the earth, but Pallas, shrouding them 45s 
In darkness, led them quickly through the town.
