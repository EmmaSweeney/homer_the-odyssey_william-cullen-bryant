NOW when the Morning, child of Dawn, ap* 
peared, 
The dear son of Ulysses left his bed 
And put his garments on. His trenchant sword 
He hung upon his shoulders, and made fast 
His shapely sandals to his shining feet, ? 

And issued from his chamber like a god. 
At once he bade the clear-voiced heralds call 
The long-haired Greeks to council. They obeyed , 
Quickly the chiefs assembled, and when all 
Were at the appointed place, Telemachus *> 

Went to the council, bearing in his hand 
A brazen spear, yet went he not alone. 



Book II. 21 

Two swift dogs followed him, while Pallas shed 

A heavenly beauty over him, and all 

Admired him as he came. He took the seat is 

Of his great father, and the aged men 

Made way for him. And then ^Egyptius spake, — 

A hero bowed with age, who much had seen 

And known. His son, the warlike Antiphus, 

Went with the great Ulysses in his fleet *> 

To courser-breeding Troy, and afterward 

The cruel Cyclops, in the vaulted cave, 

Slew him for his last meal. Three other sons 

There were, and one of these, Eurynomus, 

Was of the suitor train ; the others took »s 

Charge of their father's acres. Never yet 

Had he forgotten his lost son or ceased 

To grieve for him, and as he spoke he wept 

" Hear, men of Ithaca, what I shall say. 
No council, no assembly, have we held a» 

Since great Ulysses in his roomy ships 
Departed from our isle. Who now is he 
That summons us ? On which of our young men 
Or elders presses this necessity ? 
Is it belike that one of you has heard 35 

Of an approaching foe, and can declare 
The tidings clearly ? Or would he propose 
And urge some other matter which concerns 
The public weal ? A just and generous mind 
I deem is his, and \ is my hope that Jove 40 

Will bring to pass the good at which he aims." 



22 The Odyssey. 

As thus he spake Ulysses' son rejoiced 
In his auspicious words, nor longer kept 
His seat, but, yielding to an inward force, 
Rose midst them all to speak, while in his hand 4s 
Pisenor, the sagacious counsellor 
And herald, placed the sceptre. Then he turned 
To the old man, ^Egyptius, speaking thus: — 

" O aged man, not far from thee is he 
Who called this council, as thou soon shalt know. $ 
Mine chiefly is the trouble ; I have brought 
No news of an approaching foe, which I 
Was first to hear, and would declare to all, 
Nor urge I other matters which concern 
The public weal ; my own necessity — 55 

The evil that has fallen on my house — 
Constrains me ; it is twofold. First, that I 
Have lost an excellent father, who was king 
Among you, and ruled o'er you with a sway 
As gentle as a father's. Greater yet 60 

Is the next evil, and will soon o'erthrow 
My house and waste my substance utterly. 
Suitors, the sons of those who, in our isle, 
Hold the chief rank, importunately press 
Round my unwilling mother. They disdain 6 5 

To ask her of Icarius, that the king 
Her father may endow her, and bestow 
His daughter on the man who best may gain 
His favor, but with every day they come 
Into our palace, sacrificing here n 



Book II. 23 

Oxen and sheep and fatling goats, and hold 
High festival, and drink the purple wine 
Unstinted, with unbounded waste ; for here 
Is no man like Ulysses to repel 
The mischief from my house. Not such are we 75 
As he was, to resist the wrong. We pass 
For weaklings, immature in valor, yet 
If I had but the power, assuredly 
I would resist, for by these men are done 
Insufferable things, nor does my house &> 

Perish with honor. Ye yourselves should feel 
Shame at these doings ; ye should dread reproach 
From those who dwell around us, and should fear 
The offended gods, lest they repay these crimes 
With vengeance. I beseech you, O my friends, 85 
Both by Olympian Jove, and her by whom 
Councils of men are summoned and dissolved, — 
The goddess Themis, — that ye all refrain, 
And leave me to my grief alone, unless 
Ulysses, my great father, may have done <k 

Wrong in his anger to the gallant Greeks, 
Which ye, by prompting men to acts like these, 
Seek to avenge on me. Far better 't were, 
Should ye yourselves destroy our goods and slay 
Our herds, since, were it so, there might in time 95 
Be some requital. We, from street to street, 
Would plead continually for recompense, 
Till all should be restored. But now ye heap 
Upon me wrongs for which is no redress." 



24 The Odyssey. 

Thus angrily he spake, and clashed to earth »• 
The sceptre, shedding tears. The people felt 
Compassion ; all were silent for a space, 
And there was none who dared with railing words 
Answer Telemachus, save one alone, 
Antinoiis, who arose and thus replied : — jo S 

" Telemachus, thou youth of braggart speech 
And boundless in abuse, what hast thou said 
To our dishonor ? Thou wouldst fix on us 
A brand of shame. The blame is not with us, 
The Achaian suitors ; 't is thy mother's fault, »° 
Skilled as she is in crafty shifts. 'T is now 
Already the third year, and soon will be 
The fourth, since she began to cozen us. 
She gives us all to hope, and sends fair words 
To each by message, yet in her own mind xi 5 

Has other purposes. This shrewd device 
She planned ; she laid upon the loom a web, 
Delicate, wide, and vast in length, and said 
Thus to us all : ' Young princes, who are come 
To woo me, since Ulysses is no more, — i» 

My noble husband, — urge me not, I pray, 
To marriage, till I finish in the loom — 
That so my threads may not be spun in vain — 
A funeral vesture for the hero-chief 
Laertes, when his fatal hour shall come "s 

With death's long sleep. Else some Achaian dame 
Might blame me, should I leave without a shroud 
Him who in life possessed such ample wealth ! - 



Book II. 25 

Such were her words, and easily they wrought 
Upon our generous minds. So went she on, 130 
Weaving that ample web, and every night 
Unravelled it by torchlight. Three full years 
She practised thus, and by the fraud deceived 
The Grecian youths ; but when the hours had brought 
The fourth year round, a woman who knew all 135 
Revealed the mystery, and we ourselves 
Saw her unravelling the ample web. 
Thenceforth, constrained, and with unwilling hands, 
She finished it. Now let the suitors make 
Their answer to thy words, that thou mayst know 140 
Our purpose fully, and the Achaians all 
May know it likewise. Send thy mother hence, 
Requiring that she wed the suitor whom 
Her father chooses and herself prefers. 
But if she still go on to treat the sons 145 

Of Greece with such despite, too confident 
In gifts which Pallas has bestowed on her 
So richly, noble arts, and faculties 
Of mind, and crafty shifts, beyond all those 
Of whom we ever heard that lived of yore, is° 

The bright-haired ladies of the Achaian race, 
Tyro, Alcmena, and Mycene, famed 
For glossy tresses, none of them endowed 
As is Penelope, though this last shift 
Be ill devised, — so long will we consume 15s 

Thy substance and estate as she shall hold 
Her present mood, the purpose which the gods 
vol. 1. 2 



26 The Odyssey. 

Have planted in her breast. She to herself 
Gains great renown, but surely brings on thee 
Loss of much goods. And now we go not hence i* 
To our affairs nor elsewhere, till she wed 
Whichever of the Greeks may please her most/' 

And then rejoined discreet Telemachus : — 
" Antinoiis, grievous wrong it were to send 
Unwilling from this palace her who bore 165 

And nursed me. Whether he be living yet 
Or dead, my father is in distant lands ; 
And should I, of my own accord and will, 
Dismiss my mother, I must make perforce 
Icarius large amends, and that were hard. m 

And he would do me mischief, and the gods 
Would send yet other evils on my head. 
For then my mother, going forth, would call 
On the grim Furies, and the general curse 
Of all men would be on me. Think not I 175 

Will ever speak that word. But if ye bear 
A sense of injury for what is past, 
Go from these halls ; provide for other feasts, 
Consuming what is yours, and visiting 
Each other's homes in turn. But if it seem i&> 

To you the wiser and the better way 
To plunder one man's goods, go on to waste 
My substance. I shall call the eternal gods 
To aid me, and, if Jupiter allow 
Fit retribution for your crimes, ye die 185 

Within this very palace unavenged." 



Book II. 27 

So spake Telemachus. The Thunderer, Jcwe, 
Sent flying from a lofty mountain-top 
Two eagles. First they floated on the wind 
Close to each other, and with wings outspread ; 190 
But as they came to where the murmuring crowd 
Was gathered just beneath their flight, they turned 
And clapped their heavy pinions, looking down 
With deadly omen on the heads below, 
And with their talons tore each other's cheeks 19s 
And necks, and then they darted to the right 
Away through Ithaca among its roofs. 
All who beheld the eagles were amazed, 
And wondered what event was near at hand. 
Among the rest an aged hero spake, «x> 

Named Hahtherses, Mastor's son. He knew. 
More truly than the others of his age, 
To augur from the flight of birds, and read 
The will of fate, — and wisely thus he spake : — 

" Hear, men of Ithaca, what I shall say. ** 

I speak of what most narrowly concerns 
The suitors, over whom already hangs 
Great peril, for Ulysses will not be 
Long at a distance from his home and friends. 
Even now he is not far, and meditates «i 

Slaughter and death to all the suitor train ; 
And evil will ensue to many more 
Of us, who dwell in sunny Ithaca. 
Now let us think what measures may restrain 
These men, — or let them of their own accord **$ 



28 The Odyssey. 

Desist, — the soonest were for them the best. 

For not as one untaught do I foretell 

Events to come, but speak of what I know. 

All things that I predicted to our chief, 

What time the Argive troops embarked for Troy, •» 

And sage Ulysses with them, are fulfilled ; 

1 said that after many hardships borne, 

And all his comrades lost, the twentieth year 

Would bring him back, a stranger to us all, — 

And all that then I spake of comes to pass." 225 

Eurymachus, the son of Polybus, 
Answered the seer : " Go to thy house, old man, 
And to thy boys, and prophesy to them, 
Lest evil come upon them. I can act, 
In matters such as these, a prophet's part ^ 

Better than thou. True, there are many birds 
That fly about in sunshine, but not all 
Are ominous. Ulysses far away 
Has perished ; well it would have been if thou 
Hadst perished with him ; then thou wouldst not 
prate 23s 

Idly of things to come, nor wouldst thou stir 
Telemachus to anger, in the hope 
Gf bearing to thy house some gift from him. 
Now let me say, and be assured my words 
Will be fulfilled : experienced as thou art, ** 

If thou by treacherous speeches shalt inflame 
A younger man than thou to violent deeds, 
The sharper punishment shall first be his, 



Book II. 29 

But we will lay on thee a penalty, 

Old man, which thou shalt find it hard to bear, 245 

And bitterly wilt thou repent And now 

Let me persuade Telemachus to send 

His mother to her father. They will make 

A marriage for her there, and give with her 

A liberal dowry, such as may become 250 

A favorite daughter on her wedding-day, 

Else never will the sons of Greece renounce, 

I think, the difficult suit. We do not fear 

Telemachus himself, though glib of speech, 

Nor care we for the empty oracle 255 

Which thou, old man, dost utter, making thee 

Only more hated. Still will his estate 

Be wasted, nor will order e'er return 

While she defers her marriage with some prince 

Of the Achaians. We shall urge our suit 260 

For that most excellent of womankind 

As rivals, nor withdraw to seek the hand 

Of others, whom we fitly might espouse." 

To this discreet Telemachus replied : — 
" Eurymachus, and ye, the illustrious train *>3 

Of suitors, I have nothing more to ask, — 
No more to say, — for now the gods and all 
The Achaians know the truth. But let me have 
A gallant bark, and twenty men to make 
From coast to coast a voyage, visiting «7«j 

Sparta and sandy Pylos, to inquire 
For my long-absent father, and the chance 



30 The Odyssey. 

Of his return, if any of mankind 

Can tell me aught, or if some rumor come 

From Jove, since thus are tidings often brought ** 

To human knowledge. Should I learn that yet 

He lives and may return, I then would wait 

A twelvemonth, though impatient. Should I hear 

That he no longer lives, I shall return 

Homeward, and pile his monument on high * 

With funeral honors thai become the dead, 

And give my mother to a second spouse." 

He spake and took his seat, and then arose 
Mentor, once comrade of the excellent chief 
Ulysses, who, departing with his Meet, ^ 

Consigned his household to the aged man, 
That they should all obey him, and that he 
Should safely keep his charge. He rose amid 
The assembly, and addressed them wisely thus ; — 

" Hear and attend, ye men of Ithaca, *» 

To what I say. Let never sceptred king 
Henceforth be gracious, mild, and merciful, 
And righteous ; rather be he deaf to prayer 
And prone to deeds of wrong, since no one now 
Remembers the divine Ulysses more, ** 

Among the people over whom he ruled 
Benignly like a father. Yet I bear 
No envy to the haughty suitors here, 
Moved as they are to deeds of violence 
By evil counsels, since, in pillaging 3« 

The substance of Ulysses, who they say 



Book II. 31 

Will nevermore return, they risk their lives. 

But I am angry with the rest, with all 

Of you who sit here mute, nor even with words 

Of stern reproof restrain their violence, 305 

Though ye so many are and they so few." 

Leiocritus, Evenor's son, rejoined : — 
" Malicious Mentor, foolish man ! what talk 
Is this of holding us in check ? 'T were hard 
For numbers even greater than our own 3*0 

To drive us from a feast. And should the prince 
Of Ithaca, Ulysses, come himself, 
Thinking to thrust the illustrious suitors forth 
That banquet in these palace halls, his queen 
Would have no cause for joy at his return, 31* 

Greatly as she desired it. He would draw 
Sure death upon himself in strife with us 
Who are so many. Thou hast spoken ill. 
Now let the people who are gathered here 
Disperse to their employments. We will leave 320 
Mentor and Halitherses, who were both 
His father's early comrades, to provide 
For the youth's voyage. He will yet remain 
A long time here,Ithink, to ask for news 
In Ithaca, and never will set sail." m 

Thus having said, he instantly dismissed 
The people ; they departed to their homes ; 
The suitors sought the palace of the prince. 

Then to the ocean-side, apart from all, 
Went forth Telemachus, and washed his hands 33* 



'32 The Odyssey. 

In the gray surf, and prayed to Pallas thus : — 

" Hear me, thou deity who yesterday, 
In visiting our palace, didst command 
That I should traverse the black deep to learn 
News of my absent father, and the chance 33s 

Of his return ! The Greeks themselves withstand, 
My purpose ; the proud suitors most of all." 

Such was his prayer, and straightway Pallas stood, 
In form and voice like Mentor, by his side, 
And thus accosted him with winged words : — 340 

" Telemachus, thou henceforth shalt not lack 
Valor or wisdom. If with thee abides 
Thy father's gallant spirit, as he was 
In deed and word, thou wilt not vainly make 
This voyage. But if thou be not in truth 34s 

The son of him and of Penelope, 
Then I rely not on thee to perform 
What thou dost meditate. Few sons are like 
Their fathers : most are worse, a very few 
Excel their parents. Since thou wilt not lack 35c 
Valor and wisdom in the coming time, 
Nor is thy father's shrewdness wanting quite 
In thee, great hope there is that happily 
This plan will be fulfilled. Regard not then 
The suitor train, their purposes and plots. 35r 

Senseless are they, as little wise as just, 
And have no thought of the black doom of death 
Now drawing near to sweep them in a day 
To their destruction. But thy enterprise 



Book II. 33 

Must suffer no delay. So much am I 360 

Thy father's friend and thine, that I will cause 

A- swift bark to be fitted out for sea, 

And will myself attend thee. Go now hence 

Among the suitors, and make ready there 

The needful stores, and let them all be put 365 

In vessels, — wine in jars, and meal, the strength 

Of man, in close thick skins, — while I engage, 

Among the people here, a willing crew. 

Ships are there in our sea-girt Ithaca 

Full many, new and old, and I will choose 370 

The best of these, and see it well equipped. 

Then will we drag it down to the broad sea." 

Thus Pallas spake, the child of Jupiter. 
Telemachus obeyed the heavenly voice, 
And stayed not ; home he hastened, where he saw 375 
Sadly the arrogant suitors in the hall, 
Busily flaying goats and roasting swine. 
Antinoiis, laughing, came to meet the youth. 
And fastened on his hand, and thus he spake : — 

" Telemachus, thou youth of lofty speech 380 

And boundless in abuse, let neither word 
Nor deed that may displease thee vex thy heart, 
But gayly eat and drink as thou wert wont. 
The Achaians generously will provide 
Whatever thou requirest, ship and men, — #* 

All chosen rowers, — that thou mayst arrive 
Sooner at sacred Pylos, there to learn 
Tidings of thy illustrious father's fate." 

2* c 



34 The Odyssey. 

Then spake discreet Telemachus in turn : — 
" Antinoiis, never could I sit with you, 390 

Arrogant ones ! in silence nor enjoy 
The feast in quiet. Is it not enough, 
O suitors, that while I was yet a child 
Ye wasted on your revelries my large 
And rich possessions ? Now that I am grown, 39s 
And, when I hear the words of other men, 
Discern their meaning, now that every day 
Strengthens my spirit, I will make the attempt 
To bring the evil fates upon your heads, 
Whether I go to Pylos or remain 4* 

Among this people. I shall surely make 
This voyage, and it will not be in vain. 
Although I go a passenger on board 
Another's ship, — since neither ship have I 
Nor rowers, — ye have judged that so were best." 405 

He spake, and quickly from the suitor's hand 
Withdrew his own. The others who prepared 
Their banquet in the palace scoffed at him, 
And flung at him their bitter taunts, and one 
Among the insolent youths reviled him thus : — w 

" Telemachus is certainly resolved 
To butcher us. He goes to bring allies 
From sandy Pylos or the Spartan coast, 
He is so bent on slaughter. Or perhaps 
He visits the rich land of Ephyre -us 

In search of deadly poisons to be thrown 
Into a cup and end us all at once." 



Book II 35 

Then said another of the haughty youths : — 
" Who knows but, wandering in his hollow bark, 
He too may perish, far from all his friends, v* 

Just as Ulysses perished ? This would bring 
Increase of labor ; it would cast on us 
The trouble to divide his goods, and give 
His palace to his mother, and to him 
Who takes the woman as his wedded wife." vs 

So spake they, but Telemachus went down 
To that high-vaulted room, his father's, where 
Lay heaps of gold and brass, and garments store 
In chests, and fragrant oils. And there stood casks 
Of delicate old wine and pure, a drink 430 

For gods, in rows against the wall, to wait 
If ever, after many hardships borne, 
Ulysses should return. Upon that room 
Close-fitting double doors were shut, and there 
Was one who night and day kept diligent watch, 435 
A woman, Eurycleia, child of Ops, 
Peisenor's son. Telemachus went in 
And called her to him, and bespake her thus : — 

" Nurse, let sweet wine be drawn into my jars, 
The finest next to that which thou dost keep 440 
Expecting our unhappy lord, if yet 
The nobly born Ulysses shall escape 
The doom of death and come to us again. 
Fill twelve, and fit the covers close, and pour 
Meal into well-sewn skins, and let the tale 445 

Be twenty measures of the flour of wheat. 



36 The Odyssey. 

This none but thou must know. Let all these things 

Be brought together ; then, as night shuts in. 

When to her upper chamber, seeking rest, 

My mother shall withdraw, I come and take 49» 

What thou providest for me. I am bound 

For Sparta and for Pylos in the sands, 

To gather news concerning the return 

Of my dear father, if I haply may." 

So spake the youth, and his beloved nurse 45s 
Sobbed, wept aloud, and spake these winged 
words : — 

" Why should there come, dear child, a thought 
like this 
Into thy heart. Why wouldst thou wander forth 
To distant regions, — thou an only son 
And dearly loved ? Ulysses, nobly born, 460 

Has perished, from his native land afar, 
'Mid a strange race. These men, when thou art gone, 
At once will lay their plots to take thy life, 
And share thy wealth among them. Stay thou here 
Among thy people ; need is none that thou 46s 

Shouldst suffer, roaming o'er the barren deep.'* 

Then spake discreet Telemachus again : — . 
" Be of good cheer, O nurse, for my design 
Is not without the sanction of a god ; 
But swear thou not to let my mother know 470 

Of my intent until the eleventh day 
Or twelfth shall pass, or till, in missing me, 
She learn of my departure, lest she weep 



Book II 37 

And stain with tears the beauty of her face." 

He spake ; the ancient woman solemnly 475 

Swore by the gods, and when the rite was o'er 
Drew wine into the jars, and poured the meal 
Into the well-sewn skins. Telemachus 
Entered the hall and joined the suitor train. 479 

Then did the blue-eyed goddess turn her thoughts 
To other plans, and taking on herself 
The semblance of Telemachus, she ranged 
The city, speaking to each man in turn, 
And bidding him at nightfall to repair 
To where the good ship lay. That gallant ship 48s 
She begged of the renowned Noemon, son 
Of Phronius, who with cheerful grace complied. 

The sun went down, the city streets lay all 
In shadow. Then she drew the good ship down 
Into the sea, and brought and put on board 49° 

The appointments every well-built galley needs, 
And moored her at the bottom of the port, 
Where, in a throng, obedient to the word 
Of Pallas, round her came her gallant crew. 

With yet a new device the blue-eyed maid 493 
Went to the palace of the godlike chief 
Ulysses, where she poured a gentle sleep 
Over the suitors. As they drank she made 
Their senses wander, and their hands let fall 
The goblets. Now no longer at the board 500 

They sat, but sallied forth, and through the town 
Went to their slumbers, for the power of sleep 



38 The Odyssey. 

Had fallen heavily upon their lids. 
Then blue-eyed Pallas from those sumptuous halls 
Summoned Telemachus. She took the form 505 
And voice of Mentor, and bespake him thus : — 

" Telemachus, already at their oars 
Sit thy well-armed companions and await 
Thy coming ; let us go without delay." 

Thus having spoken, Pallas led the way 510 

With rapid footsteps which he followed fast ; 
Till having reached the galley and the sea 
They found their long-haired comrades at the beach, 
And thus the gallant prince Telemachus 
Bespake them : " Hither, comrades, let us bring 515 
The sea-stores from the dwelling where they lie ; 
My mother knows not of it, nor her maids ; 
The secret has been told to one alone." 

He spake, and went before them. In his steps 
They followed. To the gallant bark they brought 520 
The stores, and, as the well-beloved son 
Of King Ulysses bade, they laid them down 
Within the hull. Telemachus went up 
The vessel's side, but Pallas first embarked, 
And at the stern sat down, while next to her 525 
Telemachus was seated. Then the crew 
Cast loose the fastenings and went all on board, 
And took their places on the rowers' seats, 
While blue-eyed Pallas sent a favoring breeze, 
A fresh wind from the west, that murmuring swept 5* 
The dark-blue main. Telemachus gave forth 



Book III. 39 

The word to wield the tackle ; they obeyed, 
And raised the fir-tree mast, and, fitting it 
Into its socket, bound it fast with cords, 
And drew and spread with firmly twisted ropes 535 
The shining sails on high. The steady wind 
Swelled out the canvas in the midst ; the ship 
Moved on, the dark sea roaring round her keel, 
As swiftly through the waves she cleft her way. 
And when the rigging of that swift black ship 540 
Was firmly in its place, they filled their cups 
With wine, and to the ever-living gods 
Poured out libations, most of all to one, 
Jove's blue-eyed daughter. Thus through all that 

night 
And all the ensuing morn they held their way.
