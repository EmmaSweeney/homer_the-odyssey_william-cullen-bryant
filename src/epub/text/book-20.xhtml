THE noble chief, Ulysses, in the porch 
Lay down to rest. An undressed bullock's 
hide 
Was under him, and over that the skins 
Of sheep, which for the daily sacrifice 
The Achaians slew. Eurynome had spread 5 

A cloak above him. There he lay awake, 
And meditated how he yet should smite 
The suitors down. Meantime, with cries of mirth 
And laughter, came the women forth to seek 
The suitors' arms. Ulysses, inly moved »> 

With anger, pondered whether he should rise 
And put them all to death, or give their shame 
A respite for another night, the last. 
His heart raged in his bosom. As a hound 
Growls, walking round her whelps, when she be* 
holds is 

A stranger, and is eager for the attack, 
So growled his heart within him, and so fierce 
Was his impatience with that shameless crew. 
He smote his breast, and thus he chid his heart : — 



160 The Odyssey. 

"Endure it, heart! thou didst bear worse than 
this. 20 

When the grim Cyclops of resistless strength 
Devoured thy brave companions, thou couldst still 
Endure, till thou by stratagem didst leave 
The cave in which it seemed that thou must die." 

Thus he rebuked his heart, and, growing calm, 23 
His heart submitted ; but the hero tossed 
From side to side. As when one turns and turns 
The stomach of a bullock filled with fat 
And blood before a fiercely blazing fire 
And wishes it were done, so did the chief 30 

Shift oft from side to side, while pondering how 
To lay a strong hand on the multitude 
Of shameless suitors. — he but one. and they 
So many. Meantime Paiias. sliding; down 
From heaven, in form a woman, came, and there sr 
Beside his bed stood over him, and spake : — 

" Why, most unhappy of the sons of men, 
Art thou still sleepless ? This is thine abode, 
And here thou hast thy consort and a son 
Whom any man might covet for his own." 40 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
u Truly, O goddess, all that thou hast said 
Is rightly spoken. This perplexes me, — 
How to lay hands upon these shameless men, 
When I am only one, and they a throng 45 

That fill the palace. Yet another thought, 
And mightier still, — if, by thy aid and Jove's, 



Book XX. i6.i 

I slay the suitors, how shall I myself 

Be safe thereafter ? Think, I pray, of this." 

And thus in turn the blue-eyed Pallas said : s» 
" O faint of spirit ! in an humbler friend 
Than I am, in a friend of mortal birth 
And less far-seeing, one might put his trust; 
But I am born a goddess, and protect 
Thy life in every danger. Let me say, ss 

And plainly say, if fifty armed bands 
Of men should gather round us, eager all 
To take thy life, thou mightest drive away, 
Unharmed by them, their herds and pampered 

flocks. 
But give thyself to sleep. To wake and watch &■ 
All night is most unwholesome. Thou shalt find 
A happy issue from thy troubles yet." 

She spake, and, shedding slumber on his lids, 
Upward the glorious goddess took her way 
Back to Olympus, when she saw that sleep 65 

Had seized him, making him forget all care 
And slackening every limb. His faithful wife 
Was still awake, and sat upright and wept 
On her soft couch, and after many tears 
The glorious lady prayed to Dian thus : — 73 

u Goddess august ! Diana, child of Jove ! 
I would that thou wouldst send into my heart 
A shaft to take my life, or that a storm 
Would seize and hurl me through the paths of air, 
And cast me into ocean's restless streams, 7? 

K 



1 62 The Odyssey. 

As once a storm, descending, swept away 

The daughters born to Pandarus. The gods 

Had slain their parents, and they dwelt alone 

As orphans in their palace, nourished there 

By blessed Venus with the curds of milk, &> 

And honey, and sweet wine, while Juno gave 

Beauty and wit beyond all womankind, 

And chaste Diana dignity of form, 

And Pallas every art that graces life. 

Then, as the blessed Venus went to ask <* 

For them, of Jove the Thunderer, on the heights 

Of his Olympian mount, the crowning gift 

Of happy marriage, — for to Jove is known 

Whatever comes to pass, and what shall be 

The fortune, good or ill, of mortal men, — 9c 

The Harpies came meantime, bore off the maids, 

And gave them to the hateful sisterhood 

Of Furies as their servants. So may those 

Who dwell upon Olympus make an end 

Of me, or fair-haired Dian strike me down, 95 

That, with the image of Ulysses still 

Before my mind, I may not seek to please 

One of less worth. This evil might be borne 

By one who weeps all day, and feels at heart 

A settled sorrow, yet can sleep at night. io« 

For sleep, when once it weighs the eyelids down, 

Makes men unmindful both of good and ill, 

And all things else. But me some deity 

Visits with fearful dreams. There lay by me, 



Book XX. 163 

This very night, one like him, as he was «* 

When with his armed men he sailed for Troy; 
And I was glad, for certainly I deemed 
It was a real presence, and no dream." 

She spake. Just then, upon her car of gold, 
Appeared the Morn. The great Ulysses heard x» 
That voice of lamentation ; anxiously 
He mused ; it seemed to him as if the queen 
Stood over him and knew him. Gathering up 
In haste the cloak and skins on which he slept, 
He laid them in the palace on a seat, ns 

But bore the bull's hide forth in open air, 
And lifted up his hands and prayed to Jove : — 

" O Father Jove, and all the gods ! if ye 
Have led me graciously, o'er land and deep, 
Across the earth, and, after suffering much, 120 

To mine own isle, let one of those who watch 
Within the palace speak some ominous word, 
And grant a sign from thee without these walls." 

So prayed he. All-providing Jupiter 
Hearkened, and thundered from the clouds around 
The bright Olympian peaks. Ulysses heard 12c 
With gladness. From a room within the house, 
In which the mills of the king's household stood, 
A woman, laboring at the quern, gave forth 
An omen also. There were twelve who toiled 130 
In making flour of barley and of wheat, — 
The strength of man. The rest were all asleep ; 
Their tasks were done ; one only, of less strength 



164 The Odyssey. 

Than any other there, kept toiling on. 

She paused a moment, stopped the whirling stone, 13s 

And spake these words, — a portent for the king : — 

" O Father Jove, the king of gods and men ! 
Thou hast just thundered from the starry heaven, 
And yet there is no cloud. To some one here 
It is a portent. O perform for me, 140 

All helpless as I am, this one request! 
Let now the suitors in this palace take 
Their last and final pleasant feast to-day, — 
These men who make my limbs, with constant toil, 
In grinding corn for them, to lose their strength, 145 
Once let them banquet here, and then no more." 

She spake ; the omen of the woman's words 
And Jove's loud thunder pleased Ulysses well ; 
And now he deemed he should avenge himself 
Upon the guilty ones. The other maids 150 

Of that fair palace of Ulysses woke 
And came together, and upon the hearth 
Kindled a steady fire. Telemachus 
Rose from his bed in presence like a god, 
Put on his garments, hung his trenchant sword *ss 
Upon his shoulder, tied to his fair feet 
The shapely sandals, took his massive spear 
Tipped with sharp brass, and, stopping as he reached 
The threshold, spake to Eurycleia thus : — 

" Dear nurse, have ye with honor fed and lodged 
Dur guest, or have ye suffered him to find ** 

A. lodging where he might, without your care ? 



Book XX. 165 

Discerning as she is, my mother pays 

High honor to the worse among her guests, 

And sends the nobler man unhonored hence." 165 

And thus the prudent Eurycleia said : 
" My child, blame not thy mother ; she deserves 
No blame. The stranger sat and drank his wine, 
All that he would, and said, when pressed to eat, 
That he desired no more. And when he thought 179 
Of sleep, she bade her maidens spread his couch ; 
But he refused a bed and rugs, like one 
Inured to misery, and beneath the porch 
Slept on an undressed bull's hide and the skins 
Of sheep, and over him we cast a cloak." 17s 

She spake ; Telemachus, his spear in hand, 
Went forth, his fleet dogs following him. He sought 
The council where the well-greaved Greeks were 

met. 
Meantime the noble Eurycleia, child 
Of Ops, Pisenor's son, bespake the maids : — 180 

" Come, some of you, at once, and sweep the floor, 
And sprinkle it, and on the shapely thrones 
Spread coverings of purple tapestry ; 
Let others wipe the tables with a sponge, 
And cleanse the beakers and the double cups, i& 
While others go for water to the fount, 
And bring it quickly, for not long to-day 
The suitors will be absent from these halls. 
They will come early to the general feast." 

She spake ; the handmaids hearkened and obeyed, 



1 66 The Odyssey. 

And twenty went to the dark well to draw 191 

The water, while the others busily 
Bestirred themselves about the house. Then came 
The servants of the chiefs, and set themselves 
Neatly to cleave the wood. Then also came 19s 
The women from the well. The swineherd last 
Came with three swine, the fattest of the herd. 
In that fair court he let them feed, and sought 
Ulysses, greeting him with courteous words : — 

" Hast thou, O stranger, found among these 

Greeks 200 

More reverence ? Art thou still their mark of scorn ?" 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" O that the gods, Eumaeus, would avenge 
The insolence of those who meditate 
Violent deeds, and make another's house 205 

Their plotting-place, and feel no touch of shame !" 

So talked they with each other. Now appeared 
Melanthius, keeper of the goats. He brought 
Goats for the suitors* banquet ; they were choice 
Beyond all others. With him also came =1= 

Two goatherds. In the echoing portico 
He bound his goats. He saw Ulvsses there, 
And thus accosted him with railing words : — 

" Stranger, art thou still here, the palace pest, 
And begging still, and wilt thou ne'er depart ? «s 
We shall not end this quarrel, I perceive, 
Till thou hast tried the flavor of my fist 
It is not decent to be begging here 



Book XX. 167 

Continually ; the Greeks have other feasts." 

He spake ; Ulysses answered not, but shook *» 
His head in silence, planning fearful things. 

Philcetius now, a master-herdsman, came, 
And for the banquet of the suitors led 
A heifer that had never yeaned, and goats 
The fatlings of the flock ; they came across »s 

The ferry, brought by those whose office is 
To bear whoever comes from shore to shore. 
He bound his animals in the sounding porch, 
And went and, standing by the swineherd, said : — 

" Who, swineherd, is the stranger newly come 2& 
To this our palace ? of what parents born, 
And of what race, and where his native land ? 
Unhappy seemingly, yet like a king 
In person. Sorrowful must be the lot 
Of men who wander to and fro on earth, 23s 

When even to kings the gods appoint distress." 

He spake, and, greeting with his offered hand 
Ulysses, said in winged words aloud : — 

" Stranger and father, hail ! and mayst thou yet 
Be happy in the years to come at least, w 

Though held in thrall by many sorrows now. 
Yet thou, All-father Jove ! art most austere 
Of all the gods, not sparing even those 
Who have their birth from thee, but bringing them 
To grief and pain. The sweat is on my brow 245 
When I behold this stranger, and my eyes 
Are filled with tears when to my mind comes back 



1 68 The Odyssey. 

The image of Ulysses, who must now, 
I think, be wandering, clothed in rags like thee, 
Among the abodes of men, if yet indeed 230 

He lives and sees the sweet light of the sun. 
But if that he be dead, and in the abode 
Of Pluto, woe is me for his dear sake ! 
The blameless chief, who when I was a boy 
Gave to me, in the Cephalenian fields, 255 

The charge of all his beeves ; and they are now 
Innumerable ; the broad-fronted race 
Of cattle never would have multiplied 
So largely under other care than mine. 
Now other masters bid me bring my beeves 260 

For their own feasts. They little heed his son, 
The palace-heir ; as little do they dread 
The vengeance of the gods ; they long to share 
Among them the possessions of the king, 
So many years unheard from. But this thought 265 
Comes to my mind again, and yet again : 
Wrong were it, while the son is yet alive, 
To drive the cattle to a foreign land, 
Where alien men inhabit ; yet 't is worse 
To stay and tend another's beeves, and bear *7<> 
This spoil. And long ago w r ould I have fled 
To some large-minded monarch, since this waste 
Is not to be endured, but that I think 
Still of my suffering lord, and hope that yet 
He may return and drive the suitors hence." *z 
Ulysses, the sagacious, answering, said : 



Book XX. 169 

u Herdsman, since thou dost seem not ill inclined, 

Nor yet unwise, and I perceive in thee 

A well-discerning mind, I therefore say, 

And pledge my solemn oath, — Jove, first of gods, 

Be witness, and this hospitable board 281 

And hearth of good Ulysses, which has here 

Received me, — while thou art within these halls 

Ulysses will assuredly return, 

And, if thou choose to look, thine eyes shall see as? 

The suitors slain, who play the master here." 

And thus the master of the herds rejoined : 
" Stranger, may Jupiter make good thy words ! 
Then shalt thou see what strength is in my arm." 

Eumaeus also prayed to all the gods, 29-° 

That now the wise Ulysses might return. 
So talked they with each other, while apart 
The suitors doomed Telemachus to death, 
And plotted how to take his life. Just then 
A bird — an eagle — on the left flew by, 295 

High up ; his talons held a timid dove. 
And then Amphinomus bespake the rest : — 

" O friends, this plan to slay Telemachus 
Must fail. And now repair we to the feast." 

So spake Amphinomus, and to his words 3<*> 

They all gave heed, and hastened to the halls 
Of the divine Ulysses, where they laid 
Their cloaks upon the benches and the thrones, 
And slaughtering the choice sheep, and fading goats, 
And porkers, and a heifer from the herd, 90s 

vol. 11. 8 



I/O The Odyssey. 

Roasted the entrails, and distributed 

A share to each. Next mingled they the wine 

In the large bowls. The swineherd brought a cup 

To every one. Philcetius, chief among 

The servants, gave from shapely canisters 310 

The bread to each. Melanthius poured the wine. 

Then putting forth their hands, they all partook 

The ready banquet. With a wise design, 

Telemachus near the stone threshold placed 

Ulysses, on a shabby seat, beside 31s 

A little table, but within the walls 

Of that strong-pillared pile. He gave him there 

Part of the entrails, and poured out for him 

The wine into a cup of gold, and said : — 

" Sit here, and drink thy wine among the rest, y 
And from the insults and assaults of these 
It shall be mine to guard thee. For this house 
Is not the common property of all ; 
Ulysses first acquired it, and for me — 
And you, ye suitors, keep your tongues from 
taunts 323 

And hands from force, lest there be wrath and strife." 

He spake ; the suitors, as they heard him, bit 
Their pressed lips, wondering at Telemachus, 
Who uttered such bold words. Antinous then, 
Eupeithes' son, bespake his fellows thus : — 33c 

" Harsh as they are, let us, O Greeks, endure 
These speeches of Telemachus. He makes 
High threats, but had Saturnian Jove allowed, 



Book XX. 171 

We should, ere this, and in these very halls, 
Have quieted our loud-tongued orator." 335 

So spake the suitor, but Telemachus 
Heeded him not. Then through the city came 
The heralds with a hallowed hecatomb, 
Due to the gods. The long-haired people thronged 
The shady grove of Phoebus, archer-god. 340 

Now when the flesh was roasted and was drawn 
From off the spits, and each was given his share, 
They held high festival. The men who served 
The banquet gave Ulysses, where he sat, 
A portion equal to their own, for so 34s 

His own dear son Telemachus enjoined. 

Yet did not Pallas cause the haughty crew 
Of suitors to refrain from stinging taunts, 
That so the spirit of Laertes' son 
Might be more deeply wounded. One there was 35° 
Among the suitors, a low-thoughted wretch ; 
Ctesippus was his name, and his abode 
Was Samos. Trusting in his father's wealth, 
He wooed the wife of the long-absent king 
Ulysses. To his insolent mates he said : — 355 

" Hear me, ye noble suitors, while I speak. 
This stranger has received an equal share, 
As is becoming ; for it were not just 
Nor seemly to pass by, in such a feast, 
The guests, whoe'er they may be, that resort 36s 
To this fair mansion of Telemachus. 
I also will bestow on him a gjiit 



172 The Odyssey. 

Of hospitality, and he in turn 

May give it to the keeper of the bath, 

Or any other of the menial train & 

That serve the household of Ulysses here." 

So speaking, with his strong right hand he flung 
A bullock's foot, which from a canister 
Hard by he plucked. Ulysses gently bowed 
His head, and shunned the blow, and grimly smiled. 
The missile struck the solid wall, and then 371 

Telemachus rebuked the suitor thus : — 

" Ctesippus, well hast thou escaped with life, 
Not having hit the stranger, who himself 
Shrank from the blow; else had I pinned thee 
through vs 

With my sharp spear. Instead of wedding feast, 
Thy father would have celebrated here 
Thy funeral rites. Let no man in these halls 
Bear himself insolently in my sight 
Hereafter, for my reason now is ripe 380 

To know the right from wrong. I was of late 
A child, and now it is enough to bear 
That ye should slay our sheep, and drink our wine, 
And eat our bread, — for what can one man do 
Against so many ? Cease this petty war 38s 

Of wrong and hatred ; but if ye desire 
To take my life, 't is well ; 't were better so. 
And rather would I die by violence 
Than live to see these most unmanly deeds, — 
Guests driven away, and women-servants hauled 390 



Book XX. 173 

Through these fair rooms by brutal wassailers." 

He ended, and the assembly all sat mute 
Till Agelaus spake, Damastor's son : — 

" O friends ! let no man here with carping words 
Gainsay what is so rightly said, nor yet 395 

Insult the stranger more, nor one of those 
Who serve the household of the godlike chief 
Ulysses in his palace. I would say 
This word in kindness to Telemachus 
And to his mother ; may it please them both ! 400 
While yet the hope was cherished in your hearts 
That wise Ulysses would return, no blame 
Could fasten on the queen that she remained 
Unwedded, and resisted those who came 
To woo her in the palace. Better so, 405 

Had he come home again. Yet now, 't is clear, 
He comes no more. Go then, Telemachus, 
And, sitting by thy mother, bid her wed 
The noblest of her wooers, and the one 
Who brings the richest gifts \ and thou possess 4«> 
Thy father's wealth in peace, and eat and drink 
At will, while she shall find another home." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 
u Nay, Agelaus, for I swear by Jove, 
And by my father's sufferings, who has died, v$ 
Or yet is wandering, far from Ithaca, 
That I do nothing to delay the choice 
And marriage of my mother. I consent 
That she become the wife of whom she list, 



174 The Odyssey. 

And him who offers most. But I should feel ♦*> 
Great shame to thrust her forth against her will, 
And with unfllial speeches ; God forbid ! " 

He ended here, and Pallas, as he spake, 
To inextinguishable laughter moved &». 

The suitors. There they sat with wandering minds ; 
They swallowed morsels foul with blood ; their eyes 
Were filled with tears ; their hearts foreboded woe. 
Then spake the godlike Theoclymenus : — 

" Unhappy men ! what may this evil be 
That overtakes you ? Every brow and face 430 

And each one's lower limbs are wrapped in night, 
And moans arise, and tears are on your cheeks. 
The walls and all the graceful cornices 
Between the pillars are bedropped with blood, 
The portico is full, these halls are full 43s 

Of shadows, hastening down to Erebus 
Amid the gloom. The sun is blotted out 
From heaven, and fearful darkness covers all." 

He spake, and loud they laughed. Eurymachus, 
The son of Polybus, in answer said : — 440 

" The stranger prattles idly ; he is come 
From some far land. Conduct him through the door, 
Young men, and send him to the market-place, 
Since all things here are darkened to his eyes." 

Then spake the godlike Theoclymenus : 445 

" Eurymachus, from thee I ask no guide, 
For I have eyes and ears, and two good feet, 
And in my breast a mind as sound as they, 



Book XX. 175 

And by the aid of these I mean to make 

My way without ; for clearly I perceive 45° 

A coming evil, which no suitor here 

Will yet escape, — no one who, in these halls 

Of the great chief, Ulysses, treats with scorn 

His fellow-man, and broods o'er guilty plans/' 

He spake, and, hastening from that noble pile, 455 
Came to Piraeus, in whose house he found 
A welcome. All the suitors, as he went, 
Looked at each other, and, the more to vex 
Telemachus, kept laughing at his guests. 
And thus an insolent youth among them said : — 460 

" No man had ever a worse set of guests 
Than thou, Telemachus. For what a wretch 
That wandering beggar is, who always wants 
His bread and wine, and is unfit for work, 
And has no strength ; in truth, a useless load 46s 
Upon the earth he treads. The other guest 
Rises to play the prophet. If thou take 
My counsel, which I give thee for thy good, 
Let them at once be put on board a bark 
Of many oars, and we will send them hence 47° 

To the Sicilians ; they will bring a price." 

So talked the suitors, but he heeded not 
Their words, and, looking toward his father, held 
His peace, expecting when he would lay hands 
Upon that insolent crew. Penelope, 47s 

Sage daughter of Icarius, took her place 
Right opposite upon a sumptuous seat, 



176 The Odyssey. 

And heard the words of every man who spake 
Within the hall. They held that midday feast 
With laughter, — a luxurious feast it was, &* 

And mirthful ; many victims had been slain 
To furnish forth the tables ; but no feast 
Could be more bitter than the later one, 
To which the goddess and that valiant man 
Would bid the guilty crew of plotters soon.
