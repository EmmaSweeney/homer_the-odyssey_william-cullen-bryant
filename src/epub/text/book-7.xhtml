SO prayed Ulysses the great sufferer. 
The strong mules bore the damsel toward the 

town, 
And when she reached her father's stately halls 
She stopped beneath the porch. Her brothers 

came 
Around her, like in aspect to the gods, 5 

And loosed the mules, and bore the garments in. 
She sought her chamber, where an aged dame 
Attendant there, an Epirote, and named 
Eurymedusa, lighted her a fire. 
She by the well-oared galleys had been brought if 
Beforetime from Epirus, and was given 
To king Alcinoiis, ruler over all 
Phaeacia's sons, who hearkened to his voice 
As if he were a god. 'T was she who reared 
White-armed Nausicaa in the royal halls, 15 

Tended her hearth, and dressed her evening meal. 

Now rose Ulysses up, and townward turned 
His steps, while friendly Pallas wrapt his way 
In darkness, lest some one among the sons 
Of the Phaeacians with unmannerly words =* 

Might call to him or ask him who he was. 
And just as he was entering that fair town 
The blue-eyed Pallas met him, in the form 
Of a young virgin with an urn. She stood 



Book VII 137 

Before him, and Ulysses thus inquired : — =s 

" Wilt thou, my daughter, guide me to the house 
Where dwells Alcinoiis, he who rules this land ? 
I am a stranger, who have come from far 
After long hardships, and of all who dwell 
Within this realm I know not even one." so 

Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, thus replied : — 
" Father and stranger, I will show the house ; 
The dwelling of my own good father stands 
Close by it. Follow silently, I pray, 
And I will lead. Look not on any man as 

Nor ask a question ; for the people here 
Affect not strangers, nor do oft receive 
With kindly welcome him who comes from far. 
They trust in their swift barks, which to and fro, 
By Neptune's favor, cross the mighty deep. 40 

Their galleys have the speed of wings or thought." 

Thus Pallas spake, and quickly led the way. 
He followed in her steps. They saw him not, — 
Those trained Phaeacian seamen, — for the power 
That led him, Pallas of the amber hair, 45 

Forbade the sight, and threw a friendly veil 
Of darkness over him. Ulysses saw, 
Wondering, the haven and the gallant ships, 
The market-place where heroes thronged, the walls 
Long, lofty, and beset with palisades, 50 

A. marvel to the sight. But when they came 
To the king's stately palace, thus began 
The blue-eyed goddess, speaking to the chief : — 



138 The Odyssey. 

" Father and stranger, here thou seest the house 
Which thou hast bid me show thee. Thou wilt 
find 5s 

The princes, nurslings of the gods, within, 
Royally feasting. Enter, and fear not ; 
The bold man ever is the better man, 
Although he come from far. Thou first of all 
Wilt see the queen. Arete is the name &> 

The people give her. She is of a stock 
The very same from which Alcinous 
The king derives his lineage. For long since 
Nausithoiis, its founder, was brought forth 
To Neptune, the great Shaker of the shores, 6 S 

By Peribcea, fairest of her sex, 
And youngest daughter of Eurymedon, 
The large of soul, who ruled the arrogant brood 
Of giants, and beheld that guilty race 
Cut off, and perished by a fate like theirs. 7* 

Her Neptune wooed j she bore to him a son, 
Large-souled Nausithoiis, whom Phseacia owned 
Its sovereign. To Nausithoiis were born 
Rhexenor and Alcinous. He who bears 
The silver bow, Apollo, smote to death » 

Rhexenor, newly wedded, in his home. 
He left no son, and but one daughter, named 
Arete ; her Alcinous made his wife. 
And honored her as nowhere else on earth 
Is any woman honored who bears charge * 

Over a husband's household. From their hearts 



Book VII 139 

Her children pay her reverence, and the king 
And all the people, for thejr look on her 
As if she were a goddess. When she goes 
Abroad into the streets, all welcome her 85 

With acclamations. Never does she fail 
In wise discernment, but decides disputes 
Kindly and justly between man and man. 
And if thou gain her favor, there is hope 
That thou mayst see thy friends once more, and 
stand 90 

In thy tall palace on thy native soil." 

The blue-eyed Pallas, having spoken thus, 
Departed o'er the barren deep. She left 
The pleasant isle of Scheria, and repaired 
To Marathon and to the spacious streets 95 

Of Athens, entering there the massive halls 
Where dwelt Erectheus, while Ulysses toward 
The gorgeous palace of Alcinoiis turned 
His steps, yet stopped and pondered ere he crossed 
The threshold. For on every side beneath 100 

The lofty roof of that magnanimous king 
A glory shone as of the sun or moon. 
There from the threshold, on each side, were walls 
Of brass that led towards the inner rooms, 
With blue steel cornices. The doors within ^ 

The massive building were of gold, and posts 
Of silver on the brazen threshold stood, 
And silver was the lintel, and above 
Its architrave was gold ; and on each side 



140 The Odyssey. 

Stood gold and silver mastiffs, the rare work w 
Of Vulcan's practised skill, placed there to guard 
The house of great Alcinoiis, and endowed 
With deathless life, that knows no touch of age. 
Along the walls within, on either side, 
And from the threshold to the inner rooms, us 

Were firmly planted thrones on which were laid 
Delicate mantles, woven by the hand<: 
Of women. The Phaeacian princes here 
Were seated ; here they ate and drank, and held 
Perpetual banquet. Slender forms of boys 120 

In gold upon the shapely altars stood, 
W T kh blazing torches in their hands to light 
At eve the palace guests ; while fifty maids 
Waited within the halls, where some in querns 
Ground small the yellow grain ; some wove the 
web 125 

Or twirled the spindle, sitting, with a quick 
Light motion, like the aspen's glancing leaves. 
The well-wrought tissues glistened as with oil. 
As far as the Phaeacian race excel 
In guiding their swift galleys o'er the deep, t& 

So far the women in their woven work 
Surpass all others. Pallas gives them skill 
In handiwork and beautiful design. 
Without the palace-court, and near the gate, 
A spacious garden of four acres lay. 13s 

A hedge enclosed it round, and lofty trees 
Flourished in generous growth within, — the pear 



Book VII 141 

And the pomegranate, and the apple-tree 
With its fair fruitage, and the luscious fig 
And olive always green. The fruit they bear 140 
Falls not, nor ever fails in winter time 
Nor summer, but is yielded all the year. 
The ever-blowing west- wind causes some 
To swell and some to ripen ; pear succeeds 
To pear ; to apple apple, grape to grape, 14? 

Fig ripens after fig. A fruitful field 
Of vines was planted near; in part it lay 
Open and basking in the sun, which dried 
The soil, and here men gathered in the grapes, 
And there they trod the wine-press. Farther on 150 
Were grapes unripened yet, which just had cast 
The flower, and others still which just began 
To redden. At the garden's furthest bound 
Were beds of many plants that all the year 
Bore flowers. There gushed two fountains : one of 
them i5i 

Ran wandering through the field ; the other flowed 
Beneath the threshold to the palace-court, 
And all the people filled their vessels there. 
Such were the blessings which the gracious gods 
Bestowed on King Alcinoiis and his house. 1&5 

Ulysses, the great sufferer, standing there, 
Admired the sight ; and when he had beheld 
The whole in silent wonderment, he crossed 
The threshold quickly, entering the hall 
Where the Phaeacian peers and princes poured i<* 



142 The Odyssey. 

Wine from their goblets to the sleepless one, 

The Argus-queller, to whose deity 

They made the last libations when they thought 

Of slumber. The great sufferer, concealed 

In a thick mist, which Pallas raised and cast 17* 

Around him, hastened through the hall and came 

Close to Arete and Alcinoiis, 

The royal pair. Then did Ulysses clasp 

Arete's knees, when suddenly the cloud 

Raised by the goddess vanished. All within 1-5 

The palace were struck mute as they beheld 

The man before them. Thus Ulysses prayed : — 

" Arete, daughter of the godlike chief 
Rhexenor ! to thy husband I am come 
And to thy knees, from many hardships borne, i&> 
And to these guests, to whom may the good gods 
Grant to live happily, and to hand down, 
Each one to his own children, in his home, 
The wealth and honors which the people's love 
Bestowed upon him. Grant me, I entreat, »*> 

An escort, that I may behold again 
And soon my own dear country. I have passed 
Long years in sorrow, far from all I love." 

He ended, and sat down upon the hearth 
Among the ashes, near the fire, and all 1* 

Were silent utterly. At length outspake 
Echeneus, oldest and most eloquent chief 
Of the Phseacians ; large his knowledge was 
Of things long past. With generous intent, 



Book VII 143 

And speaking to the assembly, he began : — 195 

" Alcinoiis, this is not a seemly sight, — 
A stranger sitting on the hearth among 
The cinders. All the others here await 
Thy order, and move not. I pray thee, raise 
The stranger up, and seat him on a throne 200 

Studded with silver. Be thy heralds called, 
And bid them mingle wine, which we may pour 
To Jove, the god of thunders, who attends 
And honors every suppliant. Let the dame 
Who oversees the palace feast provide =05 

Our guest a banquet from the stores within." 

This when the reverend king Alcinoiis heard, 
Forthwith he took Ulysses by the hand, — 
That man of wise devices, — raised him up 
And seated him upon a shining throne, 210 

From which he bade Laodamas arise, 
His manly son, whose seat was next to his. 

" Now mingle wine, Protonoiis, in a vase, 
For all within the palace, to be poured 
To Jove, the god of thunders, who attends 215 

And honors every suppliant." As he spake 
Protonoiis mingled the delicious wines, 
And passed from right to left, distributing 
The cups to all ; and when they all had poured 
A part to Jove, and all had drunk their fill, 2* 

Alcinoiis took the word, and thus he said : — 

" Princes and chiefs of the Phaeacians, hear, 
i speak as my heart bids me. Since the feast 



144 The Odyssey. 

Is over, take your rest within your homes. 

To-morrow shall the Senators be called 225 

In larger concourse. We will pay our guest 

Due honor in the palace, worshipping 

The gods with solemn sacrifice. And then 

Will we bethink us how to send him home, 

That with no hindrance and no hardship borne 230 

Under our escort he may come again 

Gladly and quickly to his native land, 

Though far away it lie, and that no wrong 

Or loss may happen to him ere he set 

Foot on its soil ; and there must he endure 23s 

Whatever, when his mother brought him forth, 

Fate and the unrelenting Sisters spun 

For the new-born. But should he prove to be 

One of the immortals who has come from heaven, 

Then have the gods a different design. ^ 

For hitherto the gods have shown themselves 

Visibly at our solemn hecatombs, 

And sat with us, and feasted like ourselves, 

And when the traveller meets with them alone, 

They never hide themselves ; for we to them m 

Are near of kin, as near as is the race 

Of Cyclops and the savage giant brood." 

Ulysses the sagacious answered him : — 
" Nay, think not so, Alcinoiis. I am not 
In form or aspect as the immortals are, 23* 

Whose habitation is the ample heaven. 
But I am like whomever thou mayst know, 



Book VIL 14S 

Among mankind, inured to suffering ; 

To them shouldst thou compare me. I could tell 

Of bitterer sorrows yet, which I have borne ; ass 

Such was the pleasure of the gods. But now 

Leave me, whatever have my hardships been, 

To take the meal before me. Naught exceeds 

The impatient stomach's importunity 

When even the afflicted and the sorrowful aeo 

Are forced to heed its call. So even now, 

Midst all the sorrow that is in my heart, 

It bids me eat and drink, and put aside 

The thought of my misfortunes till itself 

Be satiate. But, ye princes, with the dawn *>i 

Provide for me, in my calamity, 

The means to reach again my native land. 

For, after all my hardships, I would die 

Willingly, could I look on my estates, 

My servants, and my lofty halls once more. ,, 270 

He ended ; they approved his words, and bade 
Set forward on his homeward way the guest 
Who spake so wisely. When they all had made 
Libations and had drunk, they each withdrew 
To sleep at home, and left the noble chief 27* 

Ulysses in the palace, where with him 
Arete and her godlike husband sat, 
While from the feast the maidens bore away 
The chargers. The white-armed Arete then 
Began to speak ; for when she cast her eyes a*> 

On the fair garments which Ulysses wore, 

YOL I. 7 J 



146 The Odyssey. 

She knew the mantle and the tunic well, 
Wrought by herself and her attendant maids, 
And thus with winged words bespake the chief: — 

" Stranger, I first must ask thee who thou art, ^ 
And of what race of men. From whom hast thou 
Received those garments? Sure thou dost not say 
That thou art come from wandering o'er the sea." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : — 
" 'T were hard, O sovereign lady, to relate 29° 

In order all my sufferings, for the gods 
Of heaven have made them many ; yet will I 
Tell all thou askest of me, and obey 
Thy bidding. Far within the ocean lies 
An island named Ogygia, where abides *x 

Calypso, artful goddess, with bright locks, 
Daughter of Atlas, and of dreaded power. 
No god consorts with her, nor any one 
Of mortal birth. But me in my distress 
Some god conveyed alone to her abode, 3<* 

When, launching his white lightning, Jupiter 
Had cloven in the midst of the black sea 
My galley. There my gallant comrades all 
Perished, but I in both my arms held fast 
The keel of my good ship, and floated on 30s 

Nine days till, on the tenth, in the dark night, 
The gods had brought me to Ogygia's isle, 
Where dwells Calypso of the radiant hair 
And dreaded might, who kindly welcomed me, 
And cherished me, and would have made my life 310 



Book VI L 14? 

immortal, and beyond the power of age 
In all the coming time. And there I wore 
Seven years away, still moistening with my tears 
The ambrosial raiment which the goddess gave. 
But when the eighth year had begun its round 313 
She counselled my departure, whether Jove 
Had so required, or she herself had changed 
Her purpose. On a raft made strong with clamps 
She placed me, sent on board an ample store 
Of bread and pleasant wine, and made me put 320 
Ambrosial garments on, and gave a soft 
And favorable wind. For seventeen days 
I held my steady course across the deep, 
And on the eighteenth day the shadowy heights 
Of your own isle appeared, and then my heart, 325 
Ill-fated as I was, rejoiced. Yet still 
Was I to struggle with calamities 
Sent by earth-shaking Neptune, who called up 
The winds against me, and withstood my way, 
And stirred the boundless ocean to its depths. 330 
Nor did the billows surfer me to keep 
My place, but swept me, groaning, from the raft, 
Whose planks they scattered. Still I labored through 
The billowy depth, and swam, till wind and wave 
Drove me against your coast. As there I sought 33s 
To land, I found the surges hurrying me 
Against huge rocks that lined the frightful shore ? 
But, turning back, I swam again and reached 
A river and the landing-place I wished. 



148 The Odyssey. 

Smooth, without rocks, and sheltered from the wind. 

I swooned, but soon revived. Ambrosial night 3v 

Came on. I left the Jove-descended stream 

And slept among the thickets, drawing round 

My limbs the withered leaves, while on my lids 

A deity poured bounteously the balm 345 

Of slumber. All night long, among the leaves, 

I slept, with all that sorrow in my heart, 

Till morn, till noon. Then as the sun went down 

The balmy slumber left me, and I saw 

Thy daughter's handmaids sporting on the shore, 350 

And her among them, goddess-like. To her 

I came a suppliant, nor did she receive 

My suit unkindly as a maid so young 

Might do, for youth is foolish. She bestowed 

Food and red wine abundantly, and gave, 35s 

When I had bathed, the garments I have on. 

Thus is my tale of suffering truly told." 

And then Alcinoiis answered him and said : — 
" Stranger, one duty hath my child o'erlooked, — 
To bid thee follow hither with her maids, 36a 

Since thou didst sue to her the first of all." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, thus replied : — 
" Blame not for that, O hero, I entreat, 
Thy faultless daughter. She commanded me 
To follow with her maids, but I refrained ?6« 

For fear and awe of thee, lest, at the sight, 
Thou mightest be displeased ; for we are prone 
To dark misgivings, — we, the sons of men." 



Book VII 149 

Again Alcinoiis spake : " The heart that beats 
Within my bosom is not rashly moved 370 

To wrath, and better is the temperate mood. 
This must I say, O Father Jupiter, 
And Pallas and Apollo ! I could wish 
That, being as thou art, and of like mind 
With me, thou wouldst receive to be thy bride 373 
My daughter, and be called my son-in-law, 
And here abide. A palace I would give, 
And riches, shouldst thou willingly remain. 
Against thy will let no Phaeacian dare 
To keep thee here. May Father Jove forbid ! 38° 
And that thou mayst be sure of my intent, 
I name to-morrow for thy voyage home. 
Sleep in thy bed till then ; and they shall row 
O'er the calm sea thy galley, till thou come 
To thine own land and home, or wheresoe'er 385 
Thou wilt, though further off the coast should be 
Than far Eubcea, most remote of lands, — 
So do the people of our isle declare, 
Who saw it when they over sea conveyed 
The fair-haired Rhadamanthus, on his way 390 

To visit Tityus, son of Earth. They went 
Thither, accomplishing with little toil 
Their voyage in the compass of a day, 
And brought the hero to our isle again. 
Now shalt thou learn, and in thy heart confess, 3-s 
How much our galleys and our youths excel 
With bladed oars to stir the whirling brine " 



150 The Odyssey. 

So spake the king, and the great sufferer 
Ulysses heard with gladness, and preferred 
A prayer, and called on Jupiter and said : — ^ 

" Grant, Father Jove, that all the king has said 
May be fulfilled ! so shall his praise go forth 
Over the foodful earth, and never die, 
And I shall see my native land again." 

So they conferred. White-armed Arete spake, 405 
And bade her maidens in the portico 
Place couches, and upon them lay fair rugs 
Of purple dye, and tapestry on these, 
And for the outer covering shaggy cloaks. 
Forth from the hall they issued, torch in hand ; 410 
And when with speed the ample bed was made, 
They came and summoned thus the chief to rest : — 

"Rise, stranger, go to rest; thy bed is made." 
Thus spake the maidens, and the thought of sleep 
Was welcome to Ulysses. So that night vs 

On his deep couch the noble sufferer 
Slumbered beneath the sounding portico. 
Alcinous laid him down in a recess 
Within his lofty palace, near to whom 
The queen his consort graced the marriage-bed.
