THEN did Ulysses cast his rags aside, 
And, leaping to the threshold, took his stand 
On its broad space, with bow and quiver filled 
With arrows. At his feet the hero poured 
The winged shafts, and to the suitors called : — 5 

" That difficult strife is ended. Now I take 
Another mark, which no man yet has hit. 
Now shall I see if I attain my aim, 
And, by the aid of Phoebus, win renown." 

He spake ; and, turning, at Antinoiis aimed 10 
The bitter shaft, — Antinoiis, who just then 
Had grasped a beautiful two-eared cup of gold, 
About to drink the wine. He little thought 
Of wounds and death ; for who, when banqueting 
Among his fellows, could suspect that one 15 

Alone against so many men would dare, 
However bold, to plan his death, and bring 
On him the doom of fate ? Ulysses struck 
The suitor with the arrow at the throat. 



196 The Odyssey. 

The point came through the tender neck behind, « 
Sideways he sank to earth ; his hand let fall 
The cup ; the dark blood in a thick warm stream 
Gushed from the nostrils of the smitten man. 
He spurned the table with his feet, and spilled 
The viands ; bread and roasted meats were flung 25 
To lie polluted on the floor. Then rose 
The suitors in a tumult, when they saw 
The fallen man ; from all their seats they rose 
Throughout the hall, and to the massive walls 
Looked eagerly ; there hung no buckler there, y 
No sturdy lance for them to wield. They called 
Thus to Ulysses with indignant words : — 

" Stranger ! in evil hour hast thou presumed 
To aim at men ; and thou shalt henceforth bear 
Part in no other contest. Even now 33 

Is thy destruction close to thee. Thy hand 
Hath slain the noblest youth in Ithaca. 
The vultures shall devour thy flesh for this." 

So each one said ; they deemed he had not slain 
The suitor wittingly ; nor did they see, *> 

Blind that they were, the doom which in that hour 
Was closing round them all. Then with a frown 
The wise Ulysses looked on them, and said: — 

" Dogs ! ye had thought I never would come back 
From Ilium's coast, and therefore ye devoured 45 
My substance here, and offered violence 
To my maid-servants, and pursued my wife 
As lovers, while I lived. Ye dreaded not 



Book XXII. 197 

The gods who dwell in the great heaven, nor feared 
Vengeance hereafter from the hands of men ; s» 
And now destruction overhangs you all." 

He spake, and all were pale with fear, and each 
Looked round for some escape from death. Alone 
Eurymachus found voice, and answered thus : — 

" If thou indeed be he, the Ithacan 55 

Ulysses, now returned to thine old home, 
Well hast thou spoken of the many wrongs 
Done to thee by the Achaians in thy house 
And in thy fields. But there the man lies slain 
Who was the cause of all. Antinoiis first 60 

Began this course of wrong. Nor were his thoughts 
So much of marriage as another aim, — 
Which Saturn's son denied him, — to bear rule 
Himself o'er those who till the pleasant fields 
Of Ithaca, first having slain thy son 65 

In ambush. But he now has met his fate. 
Spare, then, thy people. We will afterward 
Make due amends in public for the waste 
Here in thy palace of the food and wine. 
For each of us shall bring thee twenty beeves, 70 
And brass and gold, until thy heart shall be 
Content. Till then we cannot blame thy wrath." 

Sternly the wise Ulysses frowned, and said : 
" Eurymachus, if thou shouldst offer me 
All that thou hast, thy father's wealth entire, 75 

And add yet other gifts, not even then 
Would I refrain from bloodshed, ere my hand 



198 The Odyssey. 

Avenged my wrongs upon the suitor-crew. 
Choose then to fight or flee, whoever hopes 
Escape from death and fate ; yet none of you & 
Will now, I think, avoid that bitter doom." 

He spake. At once their knees and head grew 
faint, 
And thus Eurymachus bespake the rest : — 

" This man, O friends, to his untamable arm 
Will give no rest, but with that bow in hand, s 5 

And quiver, will send forth from where he stands 
His shafts, till he has slain us all. Prepare 
For combat then, and draw your swords, and hold 
The tables up against his deadly shafts, 
And rush together at him as one man, 9° 

And drive him from the threshold through the door. 
Then, hurrying through the city, let us sound 
The alarm, and soon he will have shot his last." 

He spake, and, drawing his keen two-edged sword 
Of brass, sprang toward him with a dreadful cry, 95 
Just as the great Ulysses, sending forth 
An arrow, smote the suitor on the breast, 
Beside the nipple. The swift weapon stood 
Fixed in his liver ; to the ground he flung 
The sword, and, reeling giddily around 100 

The table, fell \ he brought with him to earth 
The viands and the double cup, and smote 
The pavement with his forehead heavily, 
And in great agony. With both his feet 
He struck and shook his throne, and darkness came 



Book XXII. 199 

Over his eyes. Then rushed Amphinomus ** 

Against the glorious chief, and drew his sword 
To thrust him from the door. Telemachus 
O'ertook him, and between his shoulders drove 
A brazen lance. Right through his breast it went, «o 
And he fell headlong, with his forehead dashed 
Against the floor. Telemachus drew back, 
And left his long spear in Amphinomus, 
Lest, while he drew it forth, some one among 
The Achaians might attack him with the sword, "5 
And thrust him through or hew him down. In haste 
He reached his father's side, and quickly said : — 

" Now, father, will I bring to thee a shield, 
Two javelins, and a helmet wrought of brass, 
Well fitted to the temples. I will case i» 

Myself in armor, and will also give 
Arms to the swineherd, and to him who tends 
The beeves ; for men in armor combat best/' 

And wise Ulysses answered : " Bring them then, 
And quickly, while I yet have arrows here 123 

For my defence, lest, when I am alone, 
They drive me from my station at the door." 

He spake. Obedient to his father's word, 
Telemachus was soon within the room 
In which the glorious arms were laid. He took 130 
Four bucklers thence, eight spears, and helmets four 
Of brass, each darkened with its horsehair crest, 
And bore them forth, and quickly stood again 
Beside his father. But he first encased 



20O The Odyssey. 

His limbs in brass ; his followers also put 13s 

Their shining armor on, and took their place 

Beside the wise Ulysses, eminent 

In shrewd devices. He, while arrows yet 

Were ready to his hand, with every aim 

Brought down a suitor ; side by side they fell. m 

But when the shafts were spent, the archer-king 

Leaned his good bow beside the shining wall, 

Against a pillar of the massive pile, 

And round his shoulders slung a fourfold shield, 

And crowned his martial forehead with a helm us 

Wrought fairly, with a heavy horsehair crest 

That nodded gallantly above, and took 

In hand the two stout lances tipped with brass. 

In the strong wall there was a postern door, 
And, near the outer threshold of the pile, 150 

A passage from it to a narrow lane, 
Closed with well-fitting doors. Ulysses bade 
The noble swineherd take his station there. 
And guard it well, as now the only way 
Of entrance. Agelaiis called aloud 155 

To all his fellows, and bespake them thus : — 

" Friends ! will no one among you all go up 
To yonder postern door, and make our plight 
Known to the people ? Then the alarm would 

spread, 
A.nd this man haply will have shot his last." i& 

Melanthius, keeper of the goats, replied : 
" Nay, noble Agelaiis ; 't is too near 



Book XXII. 2or 

The palace gate ; the entrance of the lane 

Is narrow, and a single man, if brave, 

Against us all might hold it. I will bring 165 

Arms from the chamber to equip you all ; 

For there within, and nowhere else, I deem, 

Ulysses and his son laid up their arms." 

Thus having said, the keeper of the goats, 
Melanthius, climbed the palace stairs, and gained 170 
The chamber of Ulysses. Taking thence 
Twelve shields, as many spears, as many helms 
Of brass, with each its heavy horsehair plume, 
He came, and gave them to the suitors' hands. 
Then sank the hero's heart, and his knees shook 171 
As he beheld the suitors putting on 
Their armor, and uplifting their long spears. 
The mighty task appalled him, and he thus 
Bespake Telemachus with winged words : — 

" Telemachus, some woman here, or else 180 

Melanthius, makes the battle hard for us." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 
" Father, I erred in this. I was the cause, 
And no one else ; I left the solid door 
Ajar ; the spy was shrewder far than I. 185 

Now, good Eumseus, shut the chamber door, 
And see if any of the palace-maids 
Have brought these arms, or if I rightly fix 
The guilt upon Melanthius, Dolius' son." 

So talked they with each other, while again 190 
Melanthius, stealing toward the chamber, thought 



202 The Odyssey. 

To bring yet other shining weapons thence. 
The noble swineherd marked him as he went, 
And quickly drawing near Ulysses said : — 

" Son of Laertes ! nobly born and wise ! 19s 

The knave whom we suspect is on his way 
Up to thy chamber. Tell me now, I pray, 
And plainly, shall I make an end of him, 
If I may prove the stronger man, or bring 
The wretch into thy presence, to endure *» 

The vengeance due to all the iniquities 
Plotted by him against thee in these halls?" 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" Telemachus and I will keep at bay 
The suitors in this place, however fierce 205 

Their onset, while ye two bind fast his hands 
And feet behind his back, and bringing him 
Into the chamber, with the door made fast 
Behind you, tie him with a double cord, 
And draw him up a lofty pillar close 210 

To the timbers of the roof, that, swinging there, 
He may live long and suffer grievous pain." 

He spake ; they hearkened and obeyed, and went 
Up to the chamber unperceived by him 
Who stood within and searched a nook for arms. 215 
On each side of the entrance, by its posts, 
They waited for Melanthius. Soon appeared 
The goatherd at the threshold of the room, 
Bearing a beautiful helmet in one hand, 
And in the other a broad ancient shield, »• 



Book XXII. 203 

Defaced by age and mould. Laertes once, 
The hero, bore it when a youth, but now 
Long time it lay unused, with gaping seams. 

They sprang and seized the goatherd, dragging 
him 
Back to the chamber by the hair ; and there 225 

They cast him, in an agony of fear, 
Upon the floor, and bound his hands and feet 
With a stout cord behind his back, as bade 
The great Ulysses, much-enduring son 
Of old Laertes. Round him then they looped 23a 
A double cord, and swung him up beside 
A lofty pillar, till they brought him near 
The timbers of the roof. And then didst thou, 
Eumaeus, say to him in jeering words : — 

" Melanthius, there mayst thou keep watch all 
night 235 

On a soft bed, a fitting place for thee ; 
And when the Mother of the Dawn shall come 
Upon her golden seat from ocean's streams, 
Thou wilt not fail to see her. Thou mayst then 
Drive thy goats hither for the suitors' feast." 240 

They left him in that painful plight, and put 
Their armor on, and closed the shining door, 
And went, and by Ulysses, versed in wiles, 
Stood breathing valor. Four were they who stood 
Upon that threshold, while their foes within 2 45 
Were many and brave. Then Pallas, child of Jove, 
Drew near, like Mentor both in shape and voice. 



204 The Odyssey. 

Ulysses saw her, and rejoiced and said : — 

" Come, Mentor, to the aid of one who loves 
And has befriended thee, thy peer in age." =s» 

Thus said Ulysses, but believed he spake 
To Pallas, scatterer of hosts. Fierce shouts 
Came from the suitors in the hall, and first, 
Thus Agelaiis railed, Damastor's son : — 

" Mentor, let not Ulysses wheedle thee 253 

To join him, and make war on us, for this 
Our purpose is, and it will be fulfilled : 
When by our hands the father and the son 
Are slain, thou also shalt be put to death 
For this attempt, and thy own head shall be 260 

The forfeit. When we shall have taken thus 
Thy life with our good weapons, we will seize 
On all thou hast, on all thy wealth within 
Thy dwelling or without, and, mingling it 
With the possessions of Ulysses, leave *>* 

W T ithin thy palaces no son of thine 
Or daughter living, and no virtuous wife 
Of thine, abiding here in Ithaca." 

He spake, and woke new anger in the heart 
Of Pallas, and she chid Ulysses thus : — 270 

" Ulysses, thou art not, in might of arm 
And courage, what thou wert when waging war 
Nine years without a pause against the men 
Of Troy for Helen's sake, the child of Jove, 
And many didst thou slay in deadly strife, */j 

And Priam's city, with its spacious streets, 



Book XXII. 205 

Was taken through thy counsels. How is it 
That, coming to thy own possessions here 
And thy own palace, thou dost sadly find 
Thy ancient valor fail thee in the strife =8o 

Against the suitors ? Now draw near, my friend, 
And stand by me, and see what I shall do, 
And own that Mentor, son of Alcimus, 
Amid a press of foes requites thy love." 

She spake, but gave not to Ulysses yet 285 

The certain victory ; for she meant to put 
To further proof the courage and the might 
Both of Ulysses and his emulous son. 
To the broad palace roof she rose, and sat 
In shape a swallow. Agelaiis now, 39° 

Damastor's son, cheered on with gallant words 
His friends ; so also did Amphimedon, 
Eurynomus, and Demoptolemus, 
Polyctor's son, Peisander, and with these 
Sagacious Polybus. These six excelled =95 

In valor all the suitors who survived, 
And they were fighting for their lives. The bow 
And the fleet shafts had smitten down their peers. 
Thus to his fellows Agelaiis spake : — 

" O friends, this man will now be forced to stay 3«> 
His fatal hand. See, Mentor leaves his side, 
After much empty boasting, and those four 
Are at the entrance gate alone. Now aim 
At him with your long spears, — not all at once, 
Let six first hurl their weapons, and may Jove n. 



206 The Odyssey. 

Grant that we strike Ulysses down, and win 
Great glory ! For the others at his side 
We care but little, if their leader fail." 

He spake ; they hearkened. Eagerly they cast 
Their lances. Pallas made their aim to err. 31° 
One struck a pillar of the massive pile; 
One struck the panelled door ; one ashen shaft, 
Heavy with metal, rang against the wall. 

And when they had escaped that flight of spears, 
Hurled from the crowd, the much-enduring man, 31s 
Ulysses, thus to his companions said : — 

" Now is the time, my friends, to send our spears 
Into the suitor-crowd, who, not content 
With wrongs already done us, seek our lives." 

He spake, and, aiming opposite, they cast y* 
Their spears. The weapon which Ulysses flung 
Slew Demoptolemus ; his son struck down 
Euryades ; the herdsman smote to death 
Peisander, and the swineherd Elatus. 
These at one moment fell, and bit the dust 33s 

Of the broad floor. Back flew the suitor-crowd 
To a recess ; and after them the four 
Rushed on, and plucked their weapons from the 
dead. 

Again the suitors threw their spears ■ again 
Did Pallas cause their aim to err. One struck 33* 
A pillar of the massive pile, and one 
The panelled door ; another ashen shaft, 
Heavy with metal, rang against the walL 



Book XXIL 207 

Yet did the weapon of Amphimedon 

Strike lightly on the wrist Telemachus. 33s 

The brass just tore the skin. Ctesippus grazed 

The shoulder of Eumaeus with his spear, 

Above the shield ; the spear flew over it 

And fell to earth. Then they who stood beside 

The sage Ulysses, versed in wiles, once more 340 

Flung their keen spears. The spoiler of walled 

towns, 
Ulysses, slew Eurydamas ; his son 
Struck down Amphimedon ; the swineherd took 
The life of Polybus ; the herdsman smote 
Ctesippus, driving through his breast the spear, 34s 
And called to him, and gloried o'er his fall : — 

" O son of Polytherses, prompt to rail ! 
Beware of uttering, in thy foolish pride, 
Big words hereafter ; leave it to the gods, 
Mightier are they than we. See, I repay 350 

The hospitable gift of a steer's foot, 
Which once the great Ulysses from thy hand 
Received, as he was passing through this hall." 

Thus spake the keeper of the horned herd. 
Meantime, Ulysses slew Damastor's son 355 

With his long spear, in combat hand to hand 
Telemachus next smote Evenor's son, 
Leiocritus. He sent the brazen spear 
Into his bowels ; through his body passed 
The weapon, and he fell upon his face. & 

His forehead struck the floor. Then Pallas held 



208 The Odyssey. 

On high her fatal aegis. From the roof 

She showed it, and their hearts grew wild with fear. 

They fled along the hall as flees a herd 

Of kine, when the swift gadfly suddenly 365 

Has come among them, and has scattered them 

In springtime, when the days are growing long. 

Meantime, like falcons with curved claws and beaks, 

That, coming from the mountain summits, pounce 

Upon the smaller birds, and make them fly 370 

Close to the fields among the snares they dread, 

And seize and slay, nor can the birds resist 

Or fly, and at the multitude of prey 

The fowlers' hearts are glad ; so did the four 

Smite right and left the suitors hurrying through 375 

The palace-hall, and fearful moans arose 

As heads were smitten by the sword, and all 

The pavement swam with blood. Leiodes then 

Sprang forward to Ulysses, clasped his knees, 

And supplicated him with winged words : — 380 

" I come, Ulysses, to thy knees. Respect 
And spare me. Never have I said or done, 
Among the women of thy household, aught 
That could be blamed, and I essayed to check 
The wrongs of other suitors. Little heed 385 

They gave my counsels, nor withheld their hands 
From evil deeds, and therefore have they drawn 
Upon themselves an evil fate. But I, 
Who have done nothing, — I their soothsayer, — 
Must I too die ? Then is there no reward »» 



Book XXIL 209 

Among the sons of men for worthy deeds." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, frowned and said : 
" If then, in truth, thou wert as thou dost boast, 
A soothsayer among these men, thy prayer 
Within these palace-walls must oft have been 395 
That far from me might be the blessed day 
Of my return, and that my wife might take 
With thee her lot, and bring forth sons to thee, 
And therefore shalt thou not escape from death." 

He spake, and seizing with his powerful hand 43© 
A falchion lying near, which from the grasp 
Of Agelaiis fell when he was slain, 
Just at the middle of the neck he smote 
Leiodes, while the words were on his lips, 
And the head fell, and lay amid the dust. «* 

Phemius, the son of Terpius, skilled in song, 
Alone escaped the bitter doom of death. 
He by constraint had sung among the train 
Of suitors, and was standing now beside 
The postern door, and held his sweet-toned lyre, 410 
And pondered whether he should leave the hall, 
And sit before the altar of the great 
Herceian Jove, where, with Laertes, once 
Ulysses oft had burned the thighs of beeves, 
Or whether he should fling himself before 41s 

Ulysses, as a suppliant, at his knees. 
This co his thought seemed wisest, — to approach 
Laertes' son, and clasp his knees. He placed 
His sweet harp on the floor, between the cup 

N 



210 TJie Odyssey. 

And silver-studded seat, and went and clasped 4» 
The hero's knees, and said in winged words : — 

" I come, Ulysses, to thy knees. Respect 
And spare me. It will be a grief to thee, 
Hereafter, shouldst thou slay a bard, who sings 
For gods and men alike. I taught myself 425 

This art ; some god has breathed into my mind 
Songs of all kinds, and I could sing to thee 
As to a god. O, seek not then to take 
My life ! Thy own dear son Telemachus 
Will bear me witness that not willingly 43-* 

Nor for the sake of lucre did I come 
To sing before the suitors at their feasts 
And in thy palace, but was forced to come 
By numbers and by mightier men than I." 

He ceased ; Telemachus, the mighty, heard 435 
And thus bespake his father at his side : — 

" Refrain ; smite not the guiltless with the sword ; 
And be the herald, Medon, also spared, 
Who in our palace had the care of me 
Through all my childhood ; if he be not slain 440 
Already by Philcetius, or by him 
Who tends the swine, or if he have not met 
Thyself, when thou wert ranging through the hail.'* 

He spake, and the sagacious Medon heard, 
As crouching underneath a throne he lay, 445 

Wrapped in the skin just taken from a steer, 
To hide from the black doom of death. He came 
From where he lay, and quickly flung aside 



Book XXII. 21 1 

The skin, and, springing forward, clasped the knees 
Of the young prince, and said in winged words : — 

" Dear youth, behold me here ; be merciful ; & 
Speak to thy father, that he put not forth 
His sword to slay me, eager as he is 
For vengeance, and incensed against the men 
Who haunt these halls to make his wealth a spoil, 455 
And in their folly hold thyself in scorn." 

He spake ; the sage Ulysses smiled and said : 
" Be of good cheer, since this my son protects 
And rescues thee. Now mayst thou well perceive, 
And say to other men, how much more safe 460 

Is doing good than evil. Go thou forth 
Out of this slaughter to the open court, 
Thou and the illustrious bard, and sit ye there, 
While here within I do what yet I must." 

He spake ; they moved away and left the hall, 46s 
And by the altar of almighty Jove 
Sat looking round them, still in fear of death. 

Meantime, Ulysses passed with searching look 
O'er all the place, to find if yet remained 
A single one of all the suitor-crew 470 

Alive, and skulking from his bitter doom. 
He saw that all had fallen in blood and dust, 
Many as fishes on the shelving beach 
Drawn from the hoary deep by those who tend 
The nets with myriad meshes. Poured abroad 475 
Upon the sand, while panting to return 
To the salt sea they lie, till the hot sun 



212 The Odyssey. 

Takes their life from them ; so the suitors lay 

Heaped on each other. Then Ulysses took 

The word, and thus bespake Telemachus : — #• 

" Go now, Telemachus, and hither call 
The nurse, Dame Eurycleia. I would say 
Somewhat to her that comes into my thought." 

So spake the chief. Telemachus obeyed 
The word, and smote the door, and called the 
nurse : — 485 

" Come hither, ancient dame, who hast in charge 
To oversee the women in their tasks ; 
My father calls thee, and would speak with thee." 

He spake ; nor flew the word in vain ; she flung 
Apart the portals of those stately rooms, 49c 

And came in haste. Before her went the prince. 
Among the corpses of the slain they found 
Ulysses, stained with blood, and grimed with dust. 
As when a lion, who has just devoured 
A bullock of the pasture, moves away, 495 

A terror to the sight, with breast and cheeks 
All bathed in blood ; so did Ulysses seem, 
His feet and hands steeped in the blood of men. 
She, when she saw the corpses and the pools 
Of blood, and knew the mighty task complete, 5» 
Was moved to shout for joy. Ulysses checked 
Her eager zeal, and said in winged words : — 

" Rejoice in spirit, dame, but calm thyself, 
And shout not. To exult aloud o'er those 
Who lie in death is an unholy thing. 5°s 



Book XXII. 213 

The pleasure of the gods, and their own guilt, 
Brought death on these ; for no respect had they 
To any of their fellow-men, — the good 
Or evil, — whosoever he might be 
That came to them, and thus on their own heads s»» 
They drew this fearful fate. Now name to me 
The women of the palace ; let me know 
Who is disloyal, and who innocent." 

Then thus the well-beloved nurse replied : 
" My son, I will declare the truth. There dwell 5*5 
Here in thy palace fifty serving-maids, 
Whom we have taught to work, to comb the fleece 
And serve the household. Twelve of these have 

walked 
The way of shame. To me they give no heed, 
Nor to Penelope herself. Thy son 520 

Has just now grown to manhood, and the queen 
Has never suffered him to rule the maids ; 
But let me now, ascending to her room, — 
The royal bower, — apprise thy wife, to whom 
Some deity has sent the gift of sleep." 525 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" Wake her not yet, but go and summon all 
The women who have wrought these shameful 
deeds." 

He spake ; the matron through the palace went 
To seek the women, and to bid them come. 530 

Meanwhile, Ulysses called Telemachus, 
The herdsman and the swineherd to his side, 



214 The Odyssey. 

And thus commanded them with wingea words : — 

" Begin to carry forth the dead, and call 
The women to your aid ; and next make clean, 53s 
With water and with thirsty sponges, all 
The sumptuous thrones and tables. When ye thus 
Have put the hall in order, lead away 
The serving-maids, and in the space between 
The kitchen vault and solid outer wall 540 

Smite them with your long swords till they give up 
The ghost, and lose the memory evermore 
Of secret meetings with the suitor-train." 

He spake ; the women came, lamenting loud 
With many tears, and carried forth the dead, 54s 
Leaning upon each other as they went, 
And placed them underneath the portico 
Of the walled court. Ulysses gave command, 
Hastening their task, as all unwillingly 
They bore the corpses forth. With water next, 550 
And thirsty sponges in their hands, they cleansed 
The sumptuous thrones and tables. Then the 

prince, 
Telemachus, with shovels cleared the floor, 
The herdsman and the swineherd aiding him, 
And made the women bear the rubbish forth. 55s 
And now when all within was once again 
In seemly order, they led forth the maids 
From that fair pile into the space between 
The kitchen vault and solid outer wall, 
A narrow space from which was no escape, s* 



Book XXII : 21 5 

And thus discreet Telemachus began : — 

" I will not take away these creatures' lives 
By a pure death, — these who so long have heaped 
Reproaches on my mother's head and mine, 
And played the wanton with the suitor-crew." 56s 

He spake, and made the hawser of a ship 
Fast to a lofty shaft ; the other end 
He wound about the kitchen vault. So high 
He stretched it that the feet of none who hung 
On it might touch the ground. As when a flock s?o 
Of broad-winged thrushes or wild pigeons strike 
A net within a thicket, as they seek 
Their perch, and find unwelcome durance there, 
So hung the women, with their heads a-row, 
And cords about their necks, that they might die 575 
A miserable death. A little while, 
And but a little, quivered their loose feet 
In air. They led Melanthius from the hall 
And through the porch, cut off his nose and ears, 
Wrenched out the parts of shame, a bloody meal 580 
For dogs, and in their anger from the trunk 
Lopped hands and feet. Then having duly washed 
Their feet and hands, they came into the hall, 
And to Ulysses ; they had done their work. 
And then to the dear nurse Ulysses said : — sss 

" Bring sulphur, dame, the cure of noxious air, 
And fire, that I may purge the hall with smoke ; 
And go, and bid Penelope come down, 
With her attendant women, and command

That all the handmaids of the household come." 590 

And thus in turn Dame Eurycleia spake : 
"Well hast thou said, my son, but suffer me 
To bring thee clothes, a tunic and a cloak, 
Nor with those rags on thy broad shoulders stand 
In thine own palace ; it becomes thee not." 595 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
<l First let a fire be kindled in this hall." 

He spake, and Eurycleia, the dear nurse, 
Obeyed, and brought the sulphur and the fire. 
Ulysses steeped in smoke the royal pile. 600 

Both hall and court. The matron, passing through 
The stately palace of Ulysses, climbed 
The stair to find and summon all the maids. 
And forth they issued, bearing in their hands 
Torches, and, crowding round Ulysses, gave 60s 
Glad greeting, seized his hands, embraced him, 

kissed 
His hands and brow and shoulders. The desire 
To weep for joy o'ercame the chief; his eyes 
O'erflowed with tears ; he sobbed ; he knew them all.
