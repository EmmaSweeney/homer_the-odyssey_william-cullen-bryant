AURORA, rising from her couch beside 
The famed Tithonus, brought the light of day 
To men and to immortals. Then the gods 
Came to their seats in council. With them came 
High-thundering Jupiter, amongst them all s 

The mightiest. Pallas, mindful of the past, 
Spake of Ulysses and his many woes, 
Grieved that he still was with the island nymph : — 

" O father Jove, and all ye blessed ones 
Who live forever ! let not sceptred king » 

Henceforth be gracious, mild, and merciful 
And righteous ; rather be he deaf to prayer 
And prone to deeds of wrong, since no one now 
Remembers the divine Ulysses more 
Among the people over whom he ruled »s 

Benignly, like a father. Still he lies, 
Weighed down by many sorrows, in the isle 
And dwelling of Calypso, who so long 



Book V. 101 

Constrains his stay. To his dear native land 

Depart he cannot ; ship arrayed with oars *> 

And seamen has he none, to bear him o'er 

The breast of the broad ocean. Nay, even now, 

Against his well-beloved son a plot 

is laid, to slay him as he journeys home 

From Pylos the divine, and from the walls as 

Of famous Sparta, whither he had gone 

To gather tidings of his father's fate." 

Then answered her the Ruler of the storms : — 
" My child, what words are these that pass thy lips ? 
Was not thy long-determined counsel this, — 30 
That in good time Ulysses should return, 
To be avenged ? Guide, then, Telemachus 
Wisely, — for so thou canst, — that, all unharmed, 
He reach his native land, and, in their barks, 
Homeward the suitor-train retrace their way." 33 

He spake, and turned to Hermes, his dear son : — 
" Hermes, — for thou in this my messenger 
Art, as in all things, — to the bright-haired nymph 
Make known my steadfast. purpose, — the return 
Of suffering Ulysses. Neither gods *o 

Nor men shall guide his voyage. On a raft, 
Made firm with bands, he shall depart and reach, 
After long hardships, on the twentieth day, 
The fertile shore of Scheria, on whose isle 
Dwell the Phaeacians, kinsmen of the gods. 4 

They like a god shall honor him, and thence 
Send him to his loved country in a ship, 



102 The Odyssey. 

With ample gifts of brass and gold, and store 

Of raiment, — wealth like which he ne'er had brought 

From conquered Ilion, had he reached his home 50 

Safely, with all his portion of the spoil. 

So is it preordained that he behold 

His friends again, and stand once more within 

His high-roofed palace, on his native soil." 

He spake ; the herald Argicide obeyed, 55 

And hastily beneath his feet he bound 
The fair, ambrosial golden sandals, worn 
To bear him over ocean like the wind, 
And o'er the boundless land. His wand he took, 
Wherewith he softly seals the eyes of men, 60 

And opens them at will from sleep. With this 
In hand, the mighty Argus-queller flew, 
And, lighting on Pieria, from the sky 
Plunged downward to the deep, and skimmed its face 
Like hovering seamew, that on the broad gulfs 65 
Of the unfruitful ocean seeks her prey, 
And often dips her pinions in the brine ; 
So Hermes flew along the waste of waves. 

But when he reached that island, far away, 
Forth from the dark-blue ocean-swell he stepped 70 
Upon the sea-beach, walking till he came 
To the vast cave in which the bright-haired nymph 
Made her abode. He found the nymph within ; 
A fire blazed brightly on the hearth, and far 
Was wafted o'er the isle the fragrant smoke n 

Of cloven cedar, burning in the flame. 



Book V. 103 

And cypress-wood. Meanwhile, in her recess, 
She sweetly sang, as busily she threw 
The golden shuttle through the web she wove. 
And all about the grotto alders grew, & 

And poplars, and sweet-smelling cypresses. 
In a green forest, high among whose boughs 
Birds of broad wing, wood-owls, and falcons built 
Their nests, and crows, with voices sounding far, 
All haunting for their food the ocean-side. s s 

A vine, with downy leaves and clustering grapes, 
Crept over all the cavern rock. Four springs 
Poured forth their glittering waters in a row, 
And here and there went wandering side by side. 
Around were meadows of soft green, o'ergrown 9° 
With violets and parsley. 'T was a spot 
Where even an immortal might awhile 
Linger, and gaze with wonder and delight. 
The herald Argus-queller stood, and saw, 
And marvelled ; but as soon as he had viewed 95 
The wonders of the place, he turned his steps, 
Entering the broad-roofed cave. Calypso there, 
The glorious goddess, saw him as he came, 
And knew him ; for the ever-living gods 
Are to each other known, though one may dwell ioj 
Far from the rest. Ulysses, large of heart, 
Was not within. Apart, upon the shore, 
He sat and sorrowed, where he oft in tears 
And sighs and vain repinings passed the hours, 
Gazing with wet eyes on the barren deep. ih 



104 The Odyssey. 

Now, placing Hermes on a shining seat 
Of state, Calypso, glorious goddess, said : 

u Thou of the golden wand, revered and loved, 
What, Hermes, brings thee hither ? Passing few 
Have been thy visits. Make thy pleasure known. ™ 
My heart enjoins me to obey, if aught 
That thou commandest be within my power ; 
But first accept the offerings due a guest." 

The goddess, speaking thus, before him placed 
A table, where the heaped ambrosia lay, "5 

And mingled the red nectar. Ate and drank 
The herald Argus-queller, and, refreshed, 
Answered the nymph, and made his message 
known : — 

" Art thou a goddess, and dost ask of me, 
A god, why came I hither ? Yet, since thou *» 
Requirest, I will truly tell the cause. 
I came unwillingly, at Jove's command ; 
For who of choice would traverse the wide waste 
Of the salt ocean, with no city near 
Where men adore the gods with solemn rites 12s 
And chosen hecatombs. No god has power 
To elude or to resist the purposes 
Of aegis-bearing Jove. With thee abides, 
He bids me say, the most unhappy man 
Of all who round the city of Priam waged 130 

The battle through nine years, and, in the tenth, 
Laying it waste, departed for their homes. 
But in their voyage they provoked the wrath 



Book V. 105 

Of Pallas, who called up the furious winds 

And angry waves against them. By his side 13s 

Sank all his gallant comrades in the deep. 

Him did the winds and waves drive hither. Him 

Jove bids thee send away with speed ; for here 

He must not perish, far from all he loves. 

So is it preordained that he behold 140 

His friends again, and stand once more within 

His high-roofed palace, on his native soil." 

He spake ; Calypso, glorious goddess, heard, 
And shuddered, and with winged words replied : — 

" Ye are unjust, ye gods, and, envious far 14s 

Beyond all other beings, ca nnot bear 
ThaL ever goddess ^p^nly ghrmlH make 
AjnoilaljQiajiJier..c_onsjoxt. Thus it was 
When once Aurora, rosy-fingered, took 
Orion for her husband ; ye were stung, 150 

Amid your blissful lives, with envious hate, 
Till chaste Diana, of the golden throne, 
Smote him with silent arrows from her bow, 
And slew him in Ortygia. Thus, again, 
When bright-haired Ceres, swayed by her own heart, 
In fields which bore three yearly harvests, met is< 
Iasion as a lover, this was known 
Erelong to Jupiter, who flung from high 
A flaming thunderbolt, and laid him dead. 
And now ye envy me, that with me dwells 160 

A mortal man. I saved him as he clung 
Alone upon his floating keel ; for Jove 



106 The Odyssey. 

Had cloven with a bolt of fire from heaven 

His galley in the midst of the black sea, 

And all his gallant comrades perished there. i 

Him kindly I received ; I cherished him, 

And promised him a life that ne'er should know 

Decay or death. But since no god has power 

To elude or to withstand the purposes 

Of aegis-bearing Jove, let him depart — i 

If so the sovereign moves him and commands — 

Over the barren deep. I send him not j 

For neither ship arrayed with oars have I, 

Nor seamen, o'er the boundless waste of waves 

To bear him hence. My counsel I will give, i 

And nothing will I hide that he should know, 

To place him safely on his native shore." 

The herald Argus-queller answered her : — 
" Dismiss him thus, and bear in mind the wrath 
Of Jove, lest it be kindled against thee." i 

Thus having said, the mighty Argicide 
Departed ; and the nymph, who now had heard 
The doom of Jove, sought the great-hearted man, 
Ulysses. Him she found beside the deep, 
Seated alone, with eyes from which the tears i 
Were never dried ; for now no more the nymph 
Delighted him ; he wasted his sweet life 
In yearning for his home. Night after night 
He slept constrained within the hollow cave, 
The unwilling by the fond ; and day by day i 

He sat upon the rocks that edged the shore, 



Book V. 107 

And in continual weeping and in sighs 
And vain repinings wore the hours away, 
Gazing through tears upon the barren deep. 
The glorious goddess stood by him and spake : — 19s 

" Unhappy I sit no longer sorrowing here, 
Nor waste life thus. Lo 1 I most willingly 
Dismiss thee hence. Rise, hew down trees, and bind 
Their trunks with brazen clamps into a raft, 
And fasten planks above, a lofty floor, 20c 

That it may bear thee o'er the dark-blue deep. 
Bread will I put on board, water, and wine, — 
Red wine, that cheers the heart, — and wrap thee 

well 
In garments, and send after thee the wind, 
That safely thou attain thy native shore, 203 

If so the gods permit thee, who abide 
In the broad heaven above, and better know 
By far than I, and far more wisely judge." 

Ulysses, the great sufferer, as she spake 
Shuddered, and thus with winged words re- 
plied : — 2i3 

" Some other purpose than to send me home 
[s in thy heart, O goddess, bidding me 
To cross this frightful sea upon a raft, — ■ 
This perilous sea, where never even ships 
Pass with their rapid keels, though Jove bestow »xs 
The wind that glads the seaman. Nay, I climb 
No raft, against thy wish, unless thou swear 
The great oath of the gods that thou in this 



108 The Odyssey. 

Dost meditate no other harm to me." 

He spake ; Calypso, glorious goddess, smiled, ^ 
And smoothed his forehead with her hand, and 
said : — 

" Perverse, and slow to see where guile is not ! 
How could thy heart permit thee thus to speak ? 
Now bear me witness, Earth, and ye broad Heavens 
Above us, and ye waters of the Styx ** 

That flow beneath us, mightiest oath of all, 
And most revered by all the blessed gods, 
That I design no other harm to thee, 
But that I plan for thee, and counsel thee 
What I would do were I in need like thine. 230 

I bear a juster mind ; my bosom holds 
A pitying heart, and not a heart of steel." 

Thus having said, the glorious goddess moved 
Away with hasty steps, and where she trod 
He followed, till they reached the vaulted cave, — 235 
The goddess and the hero. There he took 
The seat whence Hermes had just risen. The 

nymph 
Brought forth whatever mortals eat and drink 
To set before him. She right opposite 
To that of great Ulysses took her seat. 240 

Ambrosia there her maidens laid, and there 
Poured nectar. Both put forth their hands, and took 
The ready viands, till at length the calls 
Of hunger and of thirst were satisfied ; 
Calypso, glorious goddess, then began : — s« 



Book V. 109 

" Son of Laertes, man of many wiles, 
High-born Ulysses ! thus wilt thou depart 
Home to thy native country ? Then farewell ; 
But, couldst thou know the sufferings Fate ordains 
For thee ere yet thou landest on its shore, 250 

Thou wouldst remain to keep this home with me 
And be immortal, strong as is thy wish 
To see thy wife, — a wish that day by day 
Possesses thee. I cannot deem myself 
In face or form less beautiful than she ; 255 

For never with immortals can the race 
Of mortal dames in form or face compare." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her : — 

" Bear with me, gracious goddess ; well I know 
All thou couldst say. The sage Penelope 260 

In feature and in stature comes not nigh 
To thee, for she is mortal, — deathless thou, 
And ever young ; yet day by day I long 
To be at home once more, and pine to see 
The hour of my return. Even though some god 265 
Smite me on the black ocean, I shall bear 
The stroke, for in my bosom dwells a mind 
Patient of suffering ; much have I endured, 
And much survived, in tempests on the deep, 
And in the battle \ let this happen too." 27. 

He spake ; the sun went down ; the night came 
on ; 
And now the twain withdrew to a recess 
Deep in the vaulted cave, where, side by side, 



no The Odyssey. 

They took their rest. But when the child of Dawn, 

Aurora, rosy-fingered, looked abroad, 27s 

Ulysses put his vest and mantle on ; 

The nymph too, in a robe of silver-white, 

Ample, and delicate, and beautiful, 

Arrayed herself, and round about her loins 

Wound a fair golden girdle, drew a veil 28c 

Over her head, and planned to send away 

Magnanimous Ulysses. She bestowed 

A heavy axe, of steel and double-edged, 

Well fitted to the hand, the handle wrought 

Of olive-wood, firm set and beautiful. 285 

A polished adze she gave him next, and led 

The way to a far corner of the isle, 

Where lofty trees, alders and poplars, stood, 

And firs that reached the clouds, sapless and diy 

Long since, and fitter thus to ride the waves. ^ 

Then, having shown where grew the tallest trees, 

Calypso, glorious goddess, sought her home. 

Trees then he felled, and soon the task was done. 
Twenty in all he brought to earth, and squared 
Their trunks with the sharp steel, and carefully -?? 
He smoothed their sides, and wrought them by a line. 
Calypso, gracious goddess, having brought 
Wimbles, he bored the beams, and, fitting them 
Together, made them fast with nails and clamps. 
As when some builder, skilful in his art, s=» 

Frames for a ship of burden the broad keel, 
Such ample breadth Ulysses gave the raft 



Book V. in 

Upon the massy beams he reared a deck, 

And floored it with long planks from end to end. 

On this a mast he raised, and to the mast 305 

Fitted a yard ; he shaped a rudder next, 

To guide the raft along her course, and round 

With woven work of willow-boughs he fenced 

Her sides against the dashings of the sea. 

Calypso, gracious goddess, brought him store 310 

Of canvas, which he fitly shaped to sails, 

And, rigging her with cords and ropes and stays, 

Heaved her with levers into the great deep. 

T was the fourth day. His labors now were done, 
And on the fifth the goddess from her isle 31s 

Dismissed him, newly from the bath, arrayed 
In garments given by her, that shed perfumes. 
A skin of dark red wine she put on board, 
A larger one of water, and for food 
A basket, stored with viands such as please 320 

The appetite. A friendly wind and soft 
She sent before. The great Ulysses spread 
His canvas joyfully to catch the breeze, 
And sat and guided with nice care the helm, 
Gazing with fixed eye on the Pleiades, 3* 

Bootes setting late, and the Great Bear, 
By others called the Wain, which, wheeling round, 
Looks ever toward Orion, and alone 
Dips not into the waters of the deep. 
For so Calypso, glorious goddess, bade 3* 

That on his ocean journey he should keep 



f 1 2 The Odyssey. 

That constellation ever on his left. 
Now seventeen days were in the voyage past, 
And on the eighteenth shadowy heights appeared, 
The nearest point of the Phaeacian land, 331 

Lying on the dark ocean like a shield. 

But mighty Neptune, coming from among 
The Ethiopians, saw him. Far away 
He saw, from mountain-heights of Solyma, 
The voyager, and burned with fiercer wrath, 340 

And shook his head, and said within himself: — 

" Strange ! now I see the gods have new designs 
For this Ulysses, formed while I was yet 
In Ethiopia. He draws near the land 
Of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed 34s 

He shall o'erpass the boundary of his woes ; 
But first, I think, he will have much to bear." 

He spake, and round about him called the clouds 
And roused the ocean, — wielding in his hand 
The trident, — summoned all the hurricanes 350 
Of all the winds, and covered earth and sky 
At once with mists, while from above the night 
Fell suddenly. The east wind and the south 
Pushed forth at once, with the strong-blowing west, 
And the clear north rolled up his mighty waves. 355 
Ulysses trembled in his knees and heart, 
And thus to his great soul, lamenting, said : — 

" What will become of me ? unhappy man ! 
I fear that all the goddess said was true, 
Foretelling what disasters should o'ertake & 



Book V. 113 

My voyage ere I reach my native land. 

Now are her words fulfilled. How Jupiter 

Wraps the great heaven in clouds and stirs the deep 

To tumult ! Wilder grow the hurricanes 

Of all the winds, and now my fate is sure. 36s 

Thrice happy, four times happy, they who fell 

On Troy's wide field, warring for Atreus' sons : 

O, had I met my fate and perished there, 

That very day on which the Trojan host, 

Around the dead Achilles, hurled at me 370 

Their brazen javelins, I had then received 

Due burial, and great glory with the Greeks ; 

Now must I die a miserable death." 

As thus he spake, upon him, from on high, 
A huge and frightful billow broke ; it whirled 37s 
The raft around, and far from it he fell. 
His hands let go the rudder ; a fierce rush 
Of all the winds together snapped in twain 
The mast ; far off the yard and canvas flew 
Into the deep ; the billow held him long 38c 

Beneath the waters, and he strove in vain 
Quickly to rise to air from that huge swell 
Of ocean, for the garments weighed him down 
Which fair Calypso gave him. But at length 
Emerging, he rejected from his throat & 

The bitter brine that down his forehead streamed. 
Even then, though hopeless with dismay, his thought 
Was on the raft ; and, struggling through the waves, 
He seized it, sprang on board, and, seated there, 

H 



114 The Odyssey. 

Escaped the threatened death. Still to and fro 390 

The rolling billows drave it. As the wind 

In autumn sweeps the thistles o'er the field, 

Clinging together, so the blasts of heaven 

Hither and thither drove it o'er the sea. 

And now the south wind flung it to the north 39i 

To buffet ; now the east wind to the west. 

Ino Leucothea saw him clinging there, — 
The delicate-footed child of Cadmus, once 
A mortal, speaking with a mortal voice, 
Though now within the ocean gulfs she shares 4a 
The honors of the gods. With pity she 
Beheld Ulysses struggling thus distressed, 
And, rising from the abyss below, in form 
A cormorant, the sea-nymph took her perch 
On the well-banded raft, and thus she said : — *. 

" Ah, luckless man ! how hast thou angered thu;* 
Earth-shaking Neptune, that he visits thee 
With these disasters ? Yet he cannot take, 
Although he seek it earnestly, thy life. 
Now do my bidding, for thou seemest wise. 4« 

Laying aside thy garments, let the raft 
Drift with the winds, while thou, by strength of arm, 
Makest thy way in swimming to the land 
Of the Phseacians, where thy safety lies. 
Receive this veil, and bind its heavenly woof 4*s 
Beneath thy breast, and have no further fear 
Of hardship or of danger. But, as soon 
As thou shalt touch the island, take it off, 



Book V. 115 

And turn away thy face, and fling it far 

From where thou standest into the black deep." 42a 

The goddess gave the veil as thus she spoke, 
And to the tossing deep went down, in form 
A cormorant ; the black wave covered her. 
But still Ulysses, mighty sufferer, 
Pondered, and thus to his great soul he said : — 42s 

" Ah me ! perhaps some god is planning here 
Some other fraud against me, bidding me 
Forsake my raft. I will not yet obey, 
For still far off I see the land in which 
'T is said my refuge lies. This will I do, 430 

For this seems wisest While the fastenings last 
That hold these timbers, I will keep my place 
And bide the tempest here ; but when the waves 
Shall dash my raft in pieces, I will swim, 
For nothing better will remain to do." *& 

As he revolved this purpose in his mind, 
Earth-shaking Neptune sent a mighty wave, 
Horrid and huge and high, and where he sat 
It smote him. As a violent wind uplifts 
The dry chaff heaped upon a threshing-floor, 440 
And sends it scattered through the air abroad, 
So did that wave fling loose the ponderous beams. 
To one of these, Ulysses, clinging fast, 
Bestrode it, like a horseman on his steed ; 
And now he took the garments off, bestowed «, 
By fair Calypso, binding round his breast 
The veil, and forward plunged into the deep, 



n6 The Odyssey. 

IVith palms outspread, prepared to swim. Mean- 
while 
Neptune beheld him, — Neptune, mighty king, — 
And shook his head, and said within himself: — 4s» 

" Go thus, and laden with mischances roam 
The waters till thou come among the race 
Cherished by Jupiter, but well I deem 
Thou wilt not find thy share of suffering light." 

Thus having said he urged his coursers on, 455 
With their fair-flowing manes, until he came 
To ^£gae, where his glorious palace stands. 

But Pallas, child of Jove, had other thoughts. 
She stayed the course of every wind beside, 
And bade them rest, and lulled them into sleep, & 
But summoned the swift north to break the waves, 
That so Ulysses, the high-born, escaped 
From death and from the fates, might be the guest 
Of the Phaeacians, — men who love the sea. 
Two days and nights among the mighty waves 465 
He floated, oft his heart foreboding death. 
But when the bright-haired Eos had fulfilled 
The third day's course, and all the winds were laid, 
And calm was on the watery waste, he saw 
That land w r as near, as, lifted on the crest 470 

Of a huge swell, he looked with sharpened sight; 
And as a father's life preserved makes glad 
His children's hearts, when long time he has lain 
Sick, wrung with pain, and wasting by the power 
Of some malignant genius, till at length 475 



Book V. 117 

ITie gracious gods bestow a welcome cure, 
So welcome to Ulysses was the sight 
Of woods and fields. By swimming on he thought 
To climb and tread the shore ; but when he drew 
So near that one who shouted could be heard 4&. 
From land, the sound of ocean on the rocks 
Came to his ear, — for there huge breakers roared 
And spouted fearfully, and all around 
Was covered with the sea-foam. Haven here 
Was none for ships, nor sheltering creek, but 
shores 485 

Beetling from high, and crags and walls of rock. 
Ulysses trembled both in knees and heart, 
And thus to his great soul, lamenting, said : — 

" Now woe is me ! as soon as Jove has shown 
What I had little hoped to see, the land, 490 

And I through all these waves have ploughed my way, 
I find no issue from the hoary deep. 
For sharp rocks border it, and all around 
Roar the wild surges ; slippery cliffs arise 
Close to deep gulfs, and footing there is none 495 
Where I might plant my steps and thus escape. 
All effort now were fruitless to resist 
The mighty billow hurrying me away 
To dash me on the pointed rocks. If yet 
I strive, by swimming further, to descry y* 

Some sloping shore or harbor of the isle, 
I fear the tempest, lest it hurl me back, 
Heavily groaning, to the fishy deep ; 



n8 The Odyssey. 

Or huge sea-monster, from the multitude 

Which sovereign Amphitrite feeds, be sent 505 

Against me by some god, — for well I know 

The power who shakes the shores is wroth with me." 

While he revolved these doubts within his mind, 
A huge wave hurled him toward the rugged coast. 
Then had his limbs been flayed, and all his bones 510 
Broken at once, had not the blue-eyed maid, 
Minerva, prompted him. Borne toward the rock, 
He clutched it instantly with both his hands, 
And panting clung till that huge wave rolled by, 
And so escaped its fury. Back it came, 515 

And smote him once again, and flung him far 
Seaward. As to the claws of Polypus, 
Plucked from its bed, the pebbles thickly cling, 
So flakes of skin, from off his powerful hands, 
Were left upon the rock. The mighty surge 520 
O'erwhelmed him ; he had perished ere his time, — 
Hapless Ulysses ! — but the blue-eyed maid, 
Pallas, informed his mind with forecast. Straight 
Emerging from the wave that shoreward rolled, 
He swam along the coast and eyed it well, 525 

In hope of sloping beach or sheltered creek. 
But when, in swimming, he had reached the mouth 
Of a soft-flowing river, here appeared 
The spot he wished for, smooth, without a rock, 
And here was shelter from the wind. He felt 53a 
The current's flow, and thus devoutly prayed : — 

" Hear me, O sovereign power, whoe'er thou art J 



Book V. 119 

To thee, the long-desired, I come. I seek 
Escape from Neptune's threatenings on the sea. 
The deathless gods respect the prayer of him 53s 
Who looks to them for help, a fugitive, 
As I am now, when to thy stream I come, 
And to thy knees, from many a hardship past. 

thou that here art ruler, I declare 

Myself thy suppliant ; be thou merciful." 5* 

He spoke : the river stayed his current, checked 
The billows, smoothed them to a calm, and gave 
The swimmer a safe landing at his mouth. 
Then dropped his knees and sinewy arms at once, 
Unstrung, for faint with struggling was his heart. 545 
His body was all swoln ; the brine gushed forth 
From mouth and nostrils ; all unnerved he lay, 
Breathless and speechless ; utter weariness 
O'ermastered him. But when he breathed again, 
And his flown senses had returned, he loosed 55° 
The veil that Ino gave him from his breast, 
And to the salt flood cast it. A great wave 
Bore it far down the stream ; the goddess there 
In her own hands received it. He, meanwhile, 
Withdrawing from the brink, lay down among 555 
The reeds, and kissed the harvest-bearing earth, 
And thus to his great soul, lamenting, said : — 

" Ah me ! what must I suffer more ? what yet 
Will happen to me ? If by the river's side 

1 pass the unfriendly watches of the night, & 
The cruel cold and dews that steep the bank 



120 The Odyssey. 

May, in this weakness, end me utterly, 

For chilly blows this river-air at dawn ; 

But should I climb this hill, to sleep within 

The shadowy wood, among thick shrubs, if cold 56s 

And weariness allow me, then I fear, 

That, while the pleasant slumbers o'er me steal, 

I may become the prey of savage beasts/' 

Yet, as he longer pondered, this seemed best. 
He rose, and sought the wood, and found it near 570 
The water, on a height, o'erlooking far 
The region round. Between two shrubs that sprang 
Both from one spot he entered, — olive-trees, 
One wild, one fruitful. The damp-blowing wind 
Ne'er pierced their covert ; never blazing sun 575 
Darted his beams within, nor pelting shower 
Beat through, so closely intertwined they grew. 
Here entering, Ulysses heaped a bed 
Of leaves with his own hands ; he made it broad 
And high, for thick the leaves had fallen around. s&> 
Two men and three, in that abundant store, 
Might bide the winter storm, though keen the cold. 
Ulysses, the great sufferer, on his couch 
Looked and rejoiced, and placed himself within, 
And heaped the leaves high o'er him and around, 585 
As one who, dwelling in the distant fields, 
Without a neighbor near him, hides a brand 
In the dark ashes, keeping carefully 
The seeds of fire alive, lest he, perforce, 
To light his hearth must bring them from afar ; a* 



Book VI. 121 

So did Ulysses in that pile of leaves 

Bury himself, while Pallas o'er his eyes 

Poured sleep, and closed his lids, that he might take, 

After his painful toils, the fitting rest.
