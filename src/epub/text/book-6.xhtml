THUS overcome with toil and weariness, 
The noble sufferer Ulysses slept, 
While Pallas hastened to the realm and town 
Peopled by the Phaeacians, who of yore 
Abode in spacious Hypereia, near 3 

The insolent race of Cyclops, and endured 
Wrong from their mightier hands. A godlike chief, 
Nausithous, led them, to a new abode, 
And planted them in Scheria, far away 
From plotting neighbors. With a wall he fenced I0 
Their city, built them dwellings there, and reared 
Fanes to the gods, and changed the plain to fields. 
But he had bowed to death, and had gone down 
To Hades, and Alcinoiis, whom the gods 
Endowed with wisdom, governed in his stead. *s 
Now to his palace, planning the return 
Of the magnanimous Ulysses, came 
The blue-eyed goddess Pallas, entering 
The gorgeous chamber where a damsel slept, — 
Nausicaa, daughter of the large-souled king *> 

vol. 1. 6 



122 The Odyssey. 

Alcinoiis, beautiful in form and face 

As one of the immortals. Near her lay, 

And by the portal,- one on either side, 

Fair as the Graces, two attendant maids. 

The shining doors were shut. But Pallas came 25 

As comes a breath of air, and stood beside 

The damsel's head and spake. In look she seemed 

The daughter of the famous mariner 

Dymas, a maiden whom Nausicaa loved, 

The playmate of her girlhood. In her shape 30 

The blue-eyed goddess stood, and thus she said : — 

" Nausicaa, has thy mother then brought forth 
A careless housewife ? Thy magnificent robes 
Lie still neglected, though thy marriage day 
Is near, when thou art to array thyself 3s 

In seemly garments, and bestow the like 
On those who lead thee to the bridal rite ; 
For thus the praise of men is won, and thus 
Thy father and thy gracious mother both 
Will be rejoiced. Now with the early dawn 40 

Let us all hasten to the washing-place. 
I too would go with thee, and help thee there, 
That thou mayst sooner end the task, for thou 
Not long wilt be unwedded. Thou art wooed 
Already by the noblest of the race 4/ 

Of the Phaeacians, for thy birth, like theirs, 
Is of the noblest. Make thy suit at morn 
To thy illustrious father, that he bid 
His mules and car be harnessed to convey 



Book VI. 123 

Thy girdles, robes, and mantles marvellous s© 

In beauty. That were seemlier than to walk, 
Since distant from the town the lavers lie." 

Thus having said, the blue-eyed Pallas went 
Back to Olympus, where the gods have made, 
So saith tradition, their eternal seat. 55 

The tempest shakes it not, nor is it drenched 
By showers, and there the snow doth never fall. 
The calm clear ether is without a cloud ; 
And in the golden light, that lies on all, 
Days after day the blessed gods rejoice. e© 

Thither the blue-eyed goddess, having given 
Her message to the sleeping maid, withdrew. 

Soon the bright morning came. Nausicaa rose, 
Clad royally, as marvelling at her dream 
She hastened through the palace to declare 65 

Her purpose to her father and the queen. 
She found them both within. Her mother sat 
Beside the hearth with her attendant maids, 
And turned the distaff loaded with a fleece 
Dyed in sea-purple. On the threshold stood 70 
Her father, going forth to meet the chiefs 
Of the Phaeacians in a council where 
Their noblest asked his presence. Then the maid, 
Approaching her beloved father, spake : — 

" I pray, dear father, give command to make 75 
A chariot ready for me, with high sides 
And sturdy wheels, to bear to the river-brink, 
There to be cleansed, the costly vobes that now 



124 The Odyssey. 

Lie soiled. Thee likewise it doth well beseem 
At councils to appear in vestments fresh &> 

And stainless. Thou hast also in these halls 
Five sons, two wedded, three in boyhood's bloom, 
And ever in the dance they need attire 
New from the wash. All this must I provide." 

She ended, for she shrank from saying aught s s 
Of her own hopeful marriage. He perceived 
Her thought and said : " Mules I deny thee not, 
My daughter, nor aught else. Go then ; my grooms 
Shall make a carriage ready with high sides 
And sturdy wheels, and a broad rack above." 90 

He spake, and gave command. The grooms 
obeyed, 
And, making ready in the outer court 
The strong-wheeled chariot, led the harnessed mules 
Under the yoke and made them fast ; and then 
Appeared the maiden, bringing from her bower 95 
The shining garments. In the polished car 
She piled them, while with many pleasant meats 
And flavoring morsels for the day's repast 
Her mother filled a hamper, and poured wine 
Into a goatskin. As her daughter climbed «<* 

The car, she gave into her hands a cruse 
Of gold with smooth anointing oil for her 
And her attendant maids. Nausicaa took 
The scourge and showy reins, and struck the mules 
To urge them onward. Onward with loud noise ** 
They went, and with a speed that slackened not, 



Book VI. 125 

&nd bore the robes and her, — yet not alone, 

For with her went the maidens of her train. 

Now when they reached the river's pleasant brink, 

Where lavers had been hollowed out to last i» 

Perpetually, and freely through them flowed 

Pure water that might cleanse the foulest stains, 

They loosed the mules, and drove them from the wain 

To browse the sweet grass by the eddying stream ; 

And took the garments out, and flung them down us 

In the dark water, and with hasty feet 

Trampled them there in frolic rivalry. 

And when the task was done, and all the stains 

Were cleansed away, they spread the garments out 

Along the beach and where the stream had washed 120 

The gravel cleanest. Then they bathed, and gave 

Their limbs the delicate oil, and took their meal 

Upon the river's border, — while the robes 

Beneath the sun's warm rays were growing dry. 

And now, when they were all refreshed by food, 125 

Mistress and maidens laid their veils aside 

And played at ball. Nausicaa the white-armed 

Began a song. As when the archer-queen 

Diana, going forth among the hills, — 

The sides of high Taygetus or slopes 130 

Of Erymanthus, — chases joyously 

Boars and fleet stags, and round her in a throng 

Frolic the rural nymphs, Latona's heart 

Is glad, for over all the rest are seen 

Her daughter's head and brow, and she at once 13s 



126 The Odyssey. 

Is known among them, though they all are fair, 
Such was this spotless virgin midst her maids. 

Now when they were about to move for home 
With harnessed mules and with the shining robes 
Carefully folded, then the blue-eyed maid, i* 

Pallas, bethought herself of this, — to rouse 
Ulysses and to bring him to behold 
The bright-eyed maiden, that she might direct 
The stranger's way to the Phaeacian town. 
The royal damsel at a handmaid cast ms 

The ball ; it missed, and fell into the stream 
Where a deep eddy whirled. All shrieked aloud. 
The great Ulysses started from his sleep 
And sat upright, discoursing to himself: — 

" Ah me ! upon what region am I thrown ? 150 
What men are here, — wild, savage, and unjust, 
Or hospitable, and who hold the gods 
In reverence ? There are voices in the air, 
Womanly voices, as of nymphs that haunt 
The mountain summits, and the river-founts, iss 
And the moist grassy meadows. Or perchance 
Am I near men who have the power of speech ? 
Nay, let me then go forth at once and learn." 

Thus having said, the great Ulysses left 
The thicket. From the close-grown wood he rent, *<*> 
With his strong hand, a branch well set with leaves, 
And wound it as a covering round his waist. 
Then like a mountain lion he went forth, 
That walks abroad, confiding in his strength, 



Book VI. \2j 

In rain and wind ; his eyes shoot fire ; he falls ** 

On oxen, or on sheep, or forest-deer, 

For hunger prompts him even to attack 

The flock within its closely guarded fold. 

Such seemed Ulysses when about to meet 

Those fair-haired maidens, naked as he was, m 

But forced by strong necessity. To them 

His look was frightful, for his limbs were foul 

With sea-foam yet. To right and left they fled 

Along the jutting river-banks. Alone 

The daughter of Alcinoiis kept her place, *?s 

For Pallas gave her courage and forbade 

Her limbs to tremble. So she waited there. 

Ulysses pondered whether to approach 

The bright-eyed damsel and embrace her knees 

And supplicate, or, keeping yet aloof, iso 

Pray her with soothing words to show the way 

Townward and give him garments. Musing thus, 

It seemed the best to keep at distance still, 

And use soft words, lest, should he clasp her knees, 

The maid might be displeased. With gentle words 185 

Skilfully ordered thus Ulysses spake : — 

" O queen, I am thy suppliant, whether thou 
Be mortal or a goddess. If perchance 
Thou art of that immortal race who dwell 
In the broad heaven, thou art, I deem, most like ** 
To Dian, daughter of imperial Jove, 
In shape, in stature, and in noble air. 
If mortal and a dweller of the earth, 



128 The Odyssey. 

Thrice happy are thy father and his queen, 

Thrice happy are thy brothers ; and their hearts t 9 s 

Must overflow with gladness for thy sake, 

Beholding such a scion of their house 

Enter the choral dance. But happiest he 

Beyond them all, who, bringing princely gifts, 

Shall bear thee to his home a bride ; for sure *» 

I never looked on one of mortal race, 

Woman or man, like thee, and as I gaze 

I wonder. Like to thee I saw of late, 

In Delos, a young palm-tree growing up 

Beside Apollo's altar ; for I sailed »s 

To Delos, with much people following me, 

On a disastrous voyage. Long I gazed 

Upon it wonder-struck, as I am now, — 

For never from the earth so fair a tree 

Had sprung. So marvel I, and am amazed aio 

At thee, O lady, and in awe forbear 

To clasp thy knees. Yet much have I endured. 

It was but yestereve that I escaped 

From the black sea, upon the twentieth day, 

So long the billows and the rushing gales 215 

Farther and farther from Ogygia's isle 

Had borne me. Now upon this shore some god 

Casts me, perchance to meet new sufferings here ; 

For yet the end is not, and many things 

The gods must first accomplish. But do thou, »* 

queen, have pity on me, since to thee 

1 come the first of all. I do not know 



Booh VI. 129 

A single dweller of the land beside. 
Show me, I pray, thy city ; and bestow 
Some poor old robe to wrap me, — if, indeed, 22s 
In coming hither, thou hast brought with thee 
Aught poor or coarse. And may the gods vouchsafe 
To thee whatever blessing thou canst wish, 
Husband and home and wedded harmony. 
There is no better, no more blessed state, 230 

Than when the wife and husband in accord 
Order their household lovingly. Then those 
Repine who hate them, those who wish them well 
Rejoice, and they themselves the most of all." 
And then the white-armed maid Nausicaa 
said : — 235 

" Since then, O stranger, thou art not malign 
Of purpose nor weak-minded, — yet, in truth, 
Olympian Jupiter bestows the goods 
Of fortune on the noble and the base 
To each one at his pleasure ; and thy griefs 240 

Are doubtless sent by him, and it is fit 
That thou submit in patience, — now that thou 
Hast reached our lands, and art within our realm, 
Thou shalt not lack for garments nor for aught 
Due to a suppliant stranger in his need. 245 

The city I will show thee, and will name 
Its dwellers, — the Phaeacians, — they possess 
The city ; all the region lying round 
Is theirs, and I am daughter of the prince 
Alcinoiis, large of soul, to whom are given 230 

6* 1 



130 The Odyssey. 

The rule of the Phaeacians and their power." 

So spake the damsel, and commanded thus 
Her fair-haired maids : " Stay ! whither do ye flee, 
My handmaids, when a man appears in sight ? 
Ye think, perhaps, he is some enemy. 255 

Nay, there is no man living now, nor yet 
Will live, to enter, bringing war, the land 
Of the Phaeacians. Very dear are they 
To the great gods. We dwell apart, afar 
Within the unmeasured deep, amid its waves *» 
The most remote of men ; no other race 
Hath commerce with us. This man comes to us 
A wanderer and unhappy, and to him 
Our cares are due. The stranger and the poor 
Are sent by Jove, and slight regards to them *>$ 
Are grateful. Maidens, give the stranger food 
And drink, and take him to the river-side 
To bathe where there is shelter from the wind." 

So spake the mistress ; and they stayed their flight 
And bade each other stand, and led the chief 27c 
Under a shelter as the royal maid, 
Daughter of stout Alcinoiis, gave command, 
And laid a cloak and tunic near the spot 
To be his raiment, and a golden cruse 
Of limpid oil. Then, as they bade him bathe 275 
In the fresh stream, the noble chieftain said : — 

" Withdraw, ye maidens, hence, while I prepare 
To cleanse my shoulders from the bitter brine, 
And to anoint them ; long have these my limbs 



Book VI. 13 1 

Been unrefreshed by oil. I will not bathe =& 

Before you. I should be ashamed to stand 
Unclothed in presence of these bright-haired maids." 

He spake ; they hearkened and withdrew, and told 
The damsel what he said. Ulysses then 
Washed the salt spray of ocean from his back 285 
And his broad shoulders in the flowing stream, 
And wiped away the sea-froth from his brows. 
And when the bath was over, and his limbs 
Had been anointed, and he had put on 
The garments sent him by the spotless maid, 290 
Jove's daughter, Pallas, caused him to appear 
Of statelier size and more majestic mien, 
And bade the locks that crowned his head flow down, 
Curling like blossoms of the hyacinth. 
As when some skilful workman trained and taught 29s 
By Vulcan and Minerva in his art 
Binds the bright silver with a verge of gold, 
And graceful is his handiwork, such grace 
Did Pallas shed upon the hero's brow 
And shoulders, as he passed along the beach, 30a 
And, glorious in his beauty and the pride 
Of noble bearing, sat aloof. The maid 
Admired, and to her bright-haired women spake : — 

" Listen to me, my maidens, while I speak. 
This man comes not among the godlike sons 301 
Of the Phaeacian stock against the will 
Of all the gods of heaven. I thought him iate 
Of an unseemly aspect ; now he bears 



132 t The Odyssey. 

A likeness to the immortal ones whose home 
Is the broad heaven. I would that I might call 3*> 
A. man like him my husband, dwelling here, 
A-nd here content to dwell. Now hasten, maids, 
And set before the stranger food and wine." 

She spake ; they heard and cheerfully obeyed, 
And set before Ulysses food and wine. 315 

The patient chief Ulysses ate and drank 
Full eagerly, for he had fasted long. 

White-armed Nausica'a then had other cares. 
She placed the smoothly folded robes within 
The sumptuous chariot, yoked the firm-hoofed 
mules, 320 

And mounted to her place, and from the seat 
Spake kindly, counselling Ulysses thus : — 

" Now, stranger, rise and follow to the town, 
And to my royal father's palace I 
Will be thy guide, where, doubt not, thou wilt 
meet 325 

The noblest men of our Phaeacian race. 
But do as I advise, — for not inapt 
I deem thee. While we traverse yet the fields 
Among the tilth, keep thou among my train 
Of maidens, following fast behind the mules 330 

And chariot. I will lead thee in the way. 
But when our train goes upward toward the town, 
Fenced with its towery wall, and on each side 
Embraced by a fair haven, with a strait 
Of narrow entrance, where our well-oared barks 335 



Book VI. 133 

Have each a mooring-place along the road, 
And there round Neptune's glorious fane extends 
A market-place, surrounded by huge stones, 
Dragged from the quarry hither, where is kept 
The rigging of the barks, — sail-cloth and ropes, — 340 
And oars are polished there, — for little reck 
Phaeacians of the quiver and the bow, 
And give most heed to masts and shrouds and ships 
Well poised, in which it is their pride to cross 
The foamy deep, — when there I would not bring 34s 
Rude taunts upon myself, for in the crowd 
Are brutal men. One of the baser sort 
Perchance might say, on meeting us : ' What man, 
Handsome and lusty-limbed, is he who thus 
Follows Nausicaa ? where was it her luck 350 

To find him ? will he be her husband yet ? 
Perhaps she brings some wanderer from his ship, 
A stranger from strange lands, for we have here 
No neighbors ; or, perhaps, it is a god 
Called down by fervent prayer from heaven to 
dwell 355 

Henceforth with her. 'T is well if she have found 
A husband elsewhere, since at home she meets 
Her many noble wooers with disdain ; 
They are Phaeacians.' Thus the crowd would say, 
And it would bring reproach upon my name. 3^ 
i too would blame another who should do 
The like, and, while her parents were alive, 
Without their knowledge should consort with men 



134 The Odyssey. 

Before her marriage. Stranger, now observe 

My words, and thou shalt speedily obtain 365 

Safe-conduct from my father, and be sent 

Upon thy voyage homeward. We shall reach 

A beautiful grove of poplars by the way, 

Sacred to Pallas ; from it flows a brook, 

And round it lies a meadow. In this spot 370 

My father has his country-grounds, and here 

His garden flourishes, as far from town 

As one could hear a shout. There sit thou down 

And wait till we are in the city's streets 

And at my father's house. When it shall seem 375 

That we are there, arise and onward fare 

To the Phaeacian city, and inquire 

Where dwells Alcinoiis the large-souled king, 

My father ; 't is not hard to find ; a child 

Might lead thee thither. Of the houses reared 380 

By the Phaeacians there is none like that 

In which Alcinoiis the hero dwells. 

When thou art once within the court and hall, 

Go quickly through the palace till thou find 

My mother where she sits beside the hearth, 385 

Leaning against a column in its blaze, 

And twisting threads, a marvel to behold, 

Of bright sea-purple, while her maidens sit 

Behind her. Near her is my father's throne, 

On which he sits at feasts, and drinks the wine 390 

Like one of the immortals. Pass it by 

And clasp my mother's knees ; so mayst thou see 



Book VI. 135 

Soon and with joy the day of thy return, 
Although thy home be, far. For if her mood 
Be kindly toward thee, thou mayst hope to greet 395 
Thy friends once more, and enter yet again 
Thy own fair palace in thy native land." 

Thus having said, she raised the shining scourge 
And struck the mules, that quickly left behind 
The river. On they went with easy pace 400 

And even steps. The damsel wielded well 
The reins, and used the lash with gentle hand, 
So that Ulysses and her train of maids 
On foot could follow close. And now the sun 
Was sinking when they came to that fair grove 405 
Sacred to Pallas. There the noble chief 
Ulysses sat him down, and instantly 
Prayed to the daughter of imperial Jove : — 

" O thou unconquerable child of Jove 
The ^Egis-bearer ! hearken to me now, 4* 

Since late thou wouldst not listen to my prayer, 
What time the mighty shaker of the shores 
Pursued and wrecked me ! Grant me to receive 
Pity and kindness from Phaeacia's sons." 

So prayed he, supplicating. Pallas heard 41s 
The prayer, but came not to him openly. 
Awe of her father's brother held her back ; 
For he would still pursue with violent hate 
Ulysses, till he reached his native land.
