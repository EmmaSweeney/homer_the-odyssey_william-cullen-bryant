THEN Pallas, hastening to the mighty realm 
Of Lacedaemon, sought the illustrious son 
Of great Ulysses, to remind the youth 
Of home, and bid him think of his return. 



44 The. Odyssey. 

She found Telemachus and Nestor's son 

Upon their couches in the portico 

Of Menelaus, the renowned. Deep sleep 

Held Nestor's son ; but to Telemachus 

The welcome slumber came not, for his thoughts 

Uneasily through all the quiet night h 

Dwelt on his father. Now beside his bed 

The blue-eyed Pallas took her stand and spake : — 

"Telemachus, it is no longer well 
That thou shouldst wander from thy home, and leave 
All thy possessions, and those arrogant men is 

That crowd thy halls. Beware, lest they devour 
Thy substance utterly, dividing all 
Among them, and this journey be for naught. 
Make suit to Menelaus, great in war, 
Quickly to send thee home, that thou mayst join 20 
Thy blameless mother in thy halls ; for now 
Her father and her brothers counsel her 
To wed Eurymachus, whose gifts exceed 
Those of the other suitors, and besides 
He offers a yet richer bridal dower. =s 

It were not hard without thy leave to take 
Wealth from a palace. What a wife will do 
Thou knowest. 'T is her pleasure to increase 
The riches of the man whom she has wed. 
Care of her former children has she none, 30 

Nor memory of the husband whom she took 
While yet a maid, and who is in his grave ; 
Of these she never speaks. Return thou, then, 



Book XV. 45 

And give thy goods in charge to one among 

The handmaids of thy household who shall seem 3s 

The fittest for the trust, until the gods 

Bring thee a noble wife. Another word 

Have I for thee, and bear thou it in mind : 

The chief among the suitors in the strait 

Between the rugged Samos and the isle *> 

Of Ithaca are lurking, in the hope 

To slay thee on thy voyage home ; but this 

I think they cannot do before the earth 

Hold many of the suitor-crew who make 

Thy wealth a spoil. Steer thou thy gallant bark 45 

Far from the isles ; sail only in the night. 

Some god, whoever it may be that keeps 

Watch over thee, will send a prosperous gale. 

When to the nearest shore of Ithaca 

Thou comest in thy ship, let it go on, 50 

With all thy comrades, to the town, while thou 

Repairest to the keeper of thy swine, 

Whose heart is faithful to thee. There remain 

With him that night, and send him to the town 

With tidings to the sage Penelope 55 

That thou art come from Pylos and art safe." 

So having said, the goddess took her way 
Up to the Olympian height. Telemachus 
Touched with his heel and wakened Nestor's son 
From a soft slumber and bespake him thus : — &> 

" Rise, Nestor's son, Peisistratus, and bring 
The firm-paced steeds and yoke them to the car, 



46 The Odyssey. 

And we will now set forth upon our way." 

And Nestor's son, Peisistratus, replied : 
" Telemachus, whatever be our haste, 
It were not well in darkness to begin 
Our journey, and the morn will soon be here. 
Remain till Menelaus, Atreus' son, 
The hero mighty with the spear, shall come, 
And bring his gifts, and place them in our car, 
And send us on our way with kindly words. 
Well does a guest remember all his days 
The generous host who shows himself his friend. 

He spake, and quickly on her car of gold 
Appeared the Mom. Then Menelaus came, 
The great in battle, from his couch beside 
The fair-haired Helen. When Telemachus 
Knew of the king's approach, the hero threw 
In haste his tunic o'er his noble form, 
And over his broad shoulders flung a cloak 
Of ample folds. Then, going forth, the son 
Of great Ulysses met the king and said : — 

"Atrides Menelaus, loved of Jove 
And sovereign of the people, send me hence, 
I pray, to the dear country of my birth, 
For earnestly I long to be at home." 

And Menelaus, great in war, replied : 
" Telemachus, I will not keep thee long, 
Since thou so much desirest to return. 
I am displeased with him who as a host 
Is lavish of his love, for he will hate 



Book XV. 47 

Beyond due measure • best it is to take 

The middle way. It is alike a wrong 

To thrust the unwilling stranger out of doors, 

And to detain him when he longs to go. 95 

While he is with us we should cherish him, 

And, when he wishes, help him to depart. 

Remain until I bring thee worthy gifts 

And place them in thy chariot, that thine eyes 

May look on them ; and I will give command 100 

That in the palace here the women spread 

A liberal feast from stores that lie within. 

But if, in turning from thy course, thou choose 

To pass through Hellas and the midland tract 

Of Argos, I will yoke my steeds and go *°5 

With thee, and show the cities thronged with men ; 

Nor will they send us empty-handed thence, 

But bring us gifts which we may bear away, — 

Tripod, perchance, or caldron wrought of brass, 

Perchance a pair of mules or golden cup." "o 

Then spake discreet Telemachus in turn : 
" Atrides Menelaus, loved of Jove 
And sovereign of the people, rather far 
Would I return to my own home ; for there 
Is no man left in charge of what is mine, "5 

And I must go, lest, while I vainly seek 
My father, I may perish, or may lose 
Some valued treasure from my palace rooms. " 

The valiant Menelaus heard, and bade 
His wife and maidens spread without delay ™ 



48 The Odyssey. 

A ready banquet from the stores within. 

Then Eteoneus from his morning sleep, 

Son of Boetheus, came, for very near 

His dwelling was. The sovereign bade him light 

A fire and roast the flesh, and he obeyed. "fi 

And then into the fragrant treasure-room 

Descended Menelaus, not alone ; 

Helen and Megapenthes went with him. 

And when they came to where the treasures lay, 

Atrides took a double goblet up, w 

And bade his son, young Megapenthes, bear 

A silver beaker thence, while Helen stood 

Beside the coffers where the embroidered robes 

Wrought by her hands were laid. The glorious 

dame 
Took one and brought it forth, most beautiful 135 
In needlework, and amplest of them all. 
The garment glittered like a star, and lay 
Below the other robes. Then, passing through 
The palace halls, they found Telemachus, 
And thus the fair-haired Menelaus spake : — 140 

" Telemachus, may Jove the Thunderer, 
Husband of Juno, grant thee to return 
According to thy wish ! I give thee here 
Of all the treasures which my house contains 
The fairest and most precious. I present 145 

A goblet all of silver, save the lips, 
And they are bound with gold ; it is the work 
Of Vulcan. Phaedimus the hero, king 



Book XV. 49 

Of the Sidonians, gave it me when once 

His palace sheltered me. He gave it me 15° 

At parting, and I now would have it thine." 

Atrides spake, and gave into his hands 
The double goblet. Megapenthes next 
Before him set the shining beaker wrought 
Of silver. Rosy Helen, holding up iss 

The robe, drew near, and spake to him and said : — 

"I also bring to thee, dear son, a gift, 
The work of Helen's hands, which thou shalt keep, 
In memory of her, until the day 
Of thy desired espousals, when thy bride 160 

Shall wear it. Let it in the mean time lie 
Within thy halls, in thy dear mother's care ; 
And mayst thou soon and happily arrive 
At thy fair palace and thy native coast." 

So spake she, placing in his hands the robe. i«s 
He took it, and was glad. Peisistratus 
Was moved with wonder as he saw, and laid 
The presents in the car. The fair-haired king 
Then led them to the hall, and seated them 
On thrones and couches, where a maiden brought 170 
Water in a fair golden ewer, and o'er 
A silver basin poured it for their hands, 
And near them set a table smoothly wrought. 
The matron of the palace brought them bread 
And many a delicate dish to please the taste 17s 
From stores within the house. Then to the board 
Boetheus' son drew near and carved the meats, 

vol. 11. 3 . D 



50 The Odyssey. 

And gave to each a portion, while the son 
Of glorious Menelaus poured the wine. 
The guests put forth their hands and shared the 
food 180 

That lay prepared before them. When the calls 
Of thirst and hunger ceased, Telemaqjius 
And Nestor's famous son brought forth and yoked 
The steeds, and climbed into the sumptuous car, 
And drove from out the echoing portico. is 5 

Atrides Menelaus, amber-haired, 
Went forth with them, and, holding in his hand 
A golden cup of generous wine, poured out 
An offering for their voyage to the gods. 
Before the steeds he took his stand, and first **> 
Drank from the cup, and then bespake the guests : — 

" Now fare ye well, young men, and when ye come 
To Nestor, shepherd of the people, give 
Greetings from me ; for he was kind to me 
As if he were a father, when the sons 195 

Of Greece were warring in the realm of Troy." 

Then spake in turn discreet Telemachus : 
" Assuredly I shall relate to him, 
As soon as I am with him, all that thou, 

foster-child of Jove, hast bid me say ; 200 
And would to heaven I might as surely tell 
Ulysses in his palace, when again 

1 come to Ithaca, how welcome thou 
Hast made me here, and how I came away 

With treasures rich and many from thy court." ** 



Book XV. 51 

As thus he spake, an eagle to the right 
Appeared, that, flying, bore a large white goose, 
Clutched from the tame flock in the palace court ; 
And men and women ran the way he flew, 
And shouted after him. Before the steeds 21c 

Of the young men, and still on the right hand, 
The bird went sweeping on. They saw well pleased, 
And every heart was gladdened. To the rest 
Peisistratus, the son of Nestor, said : — 

" Now tell me, Menelaus, loved of Jove, 215 

Prince of the people ! does the god who sends 
This portent mean the sign for us or thee?" 

He spake ; and Menelaus, dear to Mars, 
Paused, thinking how to answer him aright, 
When thus the long-robed Helen interposed: — 220 

" Listen to me, and I will prophesy 
As the gods prompt me, and as I believe 
The event will be. Just as this eagle came 
From the wild hills, his birthplace and his haunt, 
And seized and bore away the water-fowl 22s 

Reared near our halls, so will Ulysses come, 
After much hardship and long wanderings, 
To his own home, to be avenged : perchance 
Already is at home, and meditates 
An evil end to all the suitor crew." 33* 

Then spake discreet Telemachus in turn : 
" May Juno's husband, Jove the Thunderer, 
So order the event, and I will there 
Make vows to thee as to a deity/' 



52 The Odyssey. 

He spake, and touched the coursers with the 
lash ; 235 

And through the city rapidly they went 
And toward the plain, and all day long they shook 
The yoke upon their necks. The sun went down : 
The roads all lay in darkness as they came 
To Pherae, and the house of Diodes, 240 

Whose father was Orsilochus, and he 
The offspring of Alpheius. There that night 
They slept ; their host was liberal of his cheer. 
But when appeared the daughter of the Dawn, 
The rosy-fingered Morn, they yoked the steeds 245 
And climbed the sumptuous car, and drove afield 
From underneath the echoing portico. 
The son of Nestor plied the lash ; the steeds 
Flew not unwillingly, and quickly reached 
The lofty citadel of Pylos. There 250 

Telemachus bespake his comrade thus : — 

" Wilt thou consent to do what I shall ask, 
O son of Nestor ? 'T is our boast that we 
Are friends because our fathers were ; besides, 
We are of equal age, and journeying thus 255 

Has made our friendship firmer. Take me not, 
O foster-child of Jove, beyond the spot 
Where lies my galley, lest against my will 
The aged Nestor should detain me here 
Through kindness, when I needs must hasten 
home." z6 ° 

He spake, and then the son of Nestor mused 



Book XV. 53 

How what his friend desired might best be done. 
And this seemed wisest after careful thought : 
He turned the chariot to the ship and shore, 
And taking out the garments and the gold, — 265 
Beautiful gifts which Menelaus gave, — 
He put them in the galley's stern, and thus 
Bespake Telemachus with winged words : — 

" Embark in haste, and summon all thy crew 
On board before I reach my home and tell 27? 

The aged king. I know how vehement 
His temper is ; he will not let thee go, 
But hastening hither to enforce thy stay, 
At Pylos, will not, I am sure, go back 
Without thee ; his displeasure will be great." 27s 

He spake, and toward the Pylian city turned 
His steeds with flowing manes, and quickly reached 
His home. Meantime Telemachus held forth 
To his companions, thus exhorting them : — 

" My friends, make ready all things in our ship 280 
And mount the deck, for we must now set sail." 

He spake, they hearkened and obeyed, and leaped 
On board and manned the benches. While he thus 
Was hastening his departure, offering prayer 
And pouring wine to Pallas at the stern, 285 

A stranger came, a seer, a fugitive 
From Argos, where his hand had slain a man. 
Melampus was his ancestor, who dwelt 
Some time in Pylos, mother of fair flocks, — 
Rich, and inhabiting a sumptuous house «* 



54 The Odyssey. 

Among the Pylians. Afterward he joined 

Another people, fleeing from his home 

And from the mighty Neleus, haughtiest 

Of living men, who, seizing his large wealth, 

Held it a year by force. Melampus lay =95 

Meantime within the house of Phylacus 

Fast bound, and suffering greatly, both because 

Of Neleus' daughter, and of his own mind 

Distempered by the unapproachable 

Erinnys. Yet did he escape from death, 30c 

And drove the lowing herds to Phylace 

And Pylos, and avenged his cruel wrong 

On Neleus, carrying off his child to be 

A consort for his brother. Then he came 

Into the realm of Argos, famed for steeds ; 30s 

For there it was decreed that he should dwell, 

And rule o'er many of the Argive race. 

And there he took a wife and built a house, — 

A lofty pile ; and there to him were born 

Antiphates and Mantius, valiant men. 3*> 

Antiphates was father of a son, 

The brave O'icleus, and to him was born 

Amphioraiis, one of those whose voice 

Rouses the nations. ^Egis-bearing Jove 

And Phcebus loved him with exceeding love ; 31s 

Yet reached he not the threshold of old age, 

But, through the treachery of his bribed wife, 

Perished too soon at Thebes. To him were born 

Two sons, Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. 



Book XV. 55 

Clytus and Polyphides were the sons 3*> 

Of Mantius ; but Aurora, she who fills 

A golden chariot, bore away to heaven 

Clytus for his great beauty, there to dwell 

Among the immortals, while Apollo gave 

To Polyphides of the noble mind 32s 

To be a prophet, first of living men, 

Since now Amphiaraiis was no more. 

His father had displeased him, and he went 

To Hyperesia, where he dwelt, and there 

Revealed to all what yet should come to pass. 330 

It was his son who now approached ; his name 
Was Theoclymenus ; he saw the prince 
Telemachus, who stood beside the swift 
Black ship, and, pouring a libation, prayed ; 
And thus he said to him in winged words : — 335 

" My friend, whom here beside this bark I find 
Making a pious offering, I entreat 
Both by that offering and the deity, 
And by thy life, and by the lives of these 
Who follow thee, declare to me the truth, 340 

And keep back naught of all that I inquire, — 
Who art thou, from what race of men, and where 
Thy city lies, and who thy parents are." 

Then spake in turn discreet Telemachus : 
Stranger, to every point I answer thee. mi 

I am by race a son of Ithaca, 
My father was Ulysses when alive, 
But he has died a miserable death ; 



56 The Odyssey. 

Long years has he been absent, and I came 

With my companions here, and this black ship, 39» 

To gather tidings of my father's fate." 

1 Then said the godlike Theoclymenus : 

" I too, like thee, am far away from home ; 

For I have slain a man of my own tribe, 

And he had many brothers, many friends, 35s 

In Argos famed for steeds. Great is the power 

Of those Achaians, and I flee from them 

And the black doom of death, to be henceforth 

A wanderer among men. O, shelter me 

On board thy galley ! I, a fugitive, ?&> 

Implore thy mercy, lest they overtake 

And slay me ; they are surely on my track." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 
" If thou desire to come on board my ship, 
I shall not hinder thee. Come with us then, 3*5 
And take a friendly share in what we have." 

So saying he received his brazen spear, 
And laid it on the good ship's deck, and went 
Himself on board, and, taking at the stern 
His place, he seated Theoclymenus 370 

Beside him. Then the mariners cast loose 
The hawsers, and Telemachus gave forth 
The order to prepare for sea. They heard 
And eagerly obeyed ; they raised the mast, 
A pine-tree stem, — and, bringing it to stand 3^ 
In its deep socket, bound it there with cords, 
And hoisted by their strongly twisted thongs 



Book XV. $7 

The ship's white sails. The blue-eyed Pallas sent 
A favorable and fresh-blowing wind, 
That swept the sky to drive more speedily 320 

The galley through the salt-sea waves. They came 
To Cruni, and to Chalcis pleasantly 
Watered by rivers. Now the sun went down ; 
Night closed around their way, but onward still 
A favorable wind from Jupiter 385 

Toward Pheras bore them, and the hallowed coast 
Of Elis, where the Epeian race bear sway, 
And then among the isles whose rocky peaks 
Rise from the waters. Here Telemachus 
Mused thoughtfully on what his fate might be, — 390 
To perish by the ambush or escape. 

Meantime Ulysses and the swineherd sat 
At meat within the lodge ; the other men 
Were at the board, and when the calls of thirst 
And hunger ceased, Ulysses spake to try 305 

The swineherd, whether he were bent to show 
Yet further kindness, and entreat his stay, 
Or whether he would send him to the town. 

"Eumaeus, hearken thou, and all the rest. 
To-morrow 't is my wish to go to town, v» 

That I may beg, and be no charge to thee 
And thy companions. Give me thy advice, 
And send a trusty guide to show the way. 
There will I roam the streets, for so I must, 
And haply some one there will give a cup 405 

Of wine and cake of meal. And when I find 
3* 



58 The Odyssey. 

The house of great Ulysses, I will tell 

The sage Penelope the news I bring. 

Nay, I would even go among the crew 

Of arrogant suitors, who perhaps might give -no 

A meal, for there is plenty at their feasts, 

And I would do whatever they require. 

For let me tell thee, and do thou give heed, 

There lives no man who can contend with me 

In menial tasks, — to keep alive a fire +t S 

With fuel, cleave dry wood, and carve and roast 

The meat and pour the wine, — whate'er is done 

By poor men waiting on the better sort." 

And thou, Eumasus, keeper of the swine, 
Didst answer in displeasure : " Woe is me ! 420 

How could thy bosom harbor such a thought ? 
O stranger ! thou must surely be resolved 
To perish if thy purpose be to go 
Among the suitor crew, whose insolence 
And riot reach the iron vault of heaven. 425 

Not such attendants minister to them 
As thou art, but fair youths arrayed in cloaks 
And tunics, with sleek heads and smooth of face. 
These wait at polished tables heavily 
Loaded with bread and flesh and wine. Stay thou 430 
Content among us, sure that no one here 
Is wearied by thy presence, neither I 
Nor any of my fellows. When he comes, 
The dear son of Ulysses will provide 
For thee the garments thou dost need, — a cloak w 



Book XV. 59 

And tunic, — and will send thee where thou wilt." 

Ulysses, the great sufferer, answered thus : 
" I pray that thou mayst be as dear to Jove, 
The great All-Father, as thou art to me, 
Since through thy kindness I enjoy a pause 440 

Amid my weary wanderings. There is naught 
Worse than a wandering life. Unseemly cares 
A hungry stomach brings to homeless men ; 
Hardship and grief are theirs. But since thou wilt 
That I remain and wait for thy young lord, 44s 

Speak to me of the mother of thy chief 
Ulysses, and his father, whom he left 
Just on the threshold of old age, if yet 
They live, and still may look upon the sun ; 
Or have they died, and passed to Pluto's realm ? " 430 

And then in turn the master swineherd spake : 
" Rightly and truly will I answer thee, 

stranger ! still Laertes lives, but prays 
Continually to Jove that he may die 

In his own house ; for sorely he laments 455 

His son long absent, and his excellent wife, 

Bride of his youth, whose death has brought on him 

Sharp sorrow, and old age before its time. 

By a sad death she died, — through wasting grief 

For her lost, glorious son. May no one here, 4* 

No friend of mine, nor one who has bestowed 

A kindness on me, die by such a death ! 

While yet she lived, great as her sorrow was, 

1 loved to speak with her and hear her words ; 



60 The Odyssey. 

For she had reared me with her youngest-born, — 4 6 5 
Her daughter, long-robed Ctimena. With her 
Was I brought up, and scarcely less than her 
Was held in honor. When at length we came 
Into the pleasant years of youth, they sent 
The princess hence to Samos, and received at 

Large presents ; but to me her mother gave 
Garments of price, a tunic and a cloak, 
And sandals for my feet, and sent me forth 
Into the fields, and loved me more and more. 
All this is over now, yet must I say ws 

My calling has been prospered by the gods. 
Prom this I have the means to eat and drink, 
And wherewithal to feast a worthy guest ; 
But from the queen I never have a word 
Or deed of kindness, since that evil came 480 

Upon her house, — that crew of lawless men. 
Greatly the servants would rejoice to speak 
Before their mistress, and inquire her will, 
And eat and drink, and carry to their homes 
Some gift, for gifts delight a servant's heart." 485 

Again Ulysses, the sagacious, spake : 
" Swineherd Eumaeus, thou, while yet a child, 
Wert doubtless strangely tossed about the world, 
Far from thy kindred and thy native land. 
Now tell me, was the spacious town wherein *» 
Thy father and thy mother dwelt laid waste ? 
Or wert thou left among the flocks and herds 
Untended, and borne off by hostile men, 



Book XV. 6 1 

Who came in ships and sold thee to the lord 

Of these possessions for a worthy price ? " 495 

And then the master swineherd spake again : 
" Since thou dost ask me, stranger, hear my words 
In silence ; sit at ease and drink thy wine. 
These nights are very long ; there 's time enough 
For sleep, and time to entertain ourselves s<» 

With talk. It is not fitting to lie down 
Ere the due hour arrive, and too much sleep 
Is hurtful. Whosoever here shall feel 
The strong desire, let him withdraw and sleep, 
And rise with early morn and break his fast, s°3 

And tend my master's swine. Let us remain 
Within, and drink and feast, and pass the time 
Gayly, relating what we have endured, 
Each one of us ; for in the after time - 
One who has suffered much and wandered far &• 
May take a pleasure even in his griefs. 

" But let me tell what thou hast asked of me : 
Beyond Ortygia lies an island named 
Syria ; thou must have heard of it. The sun 
Above it turns his course. It is not large, s^s 

But fruitful, fit for pasturage, and rich 
In flocks, abounding both in wine and wheat. 
There never famine comes, nor foul disease 
Fastens on wretched mortals ; but when men 
Grow old, Apollo of the silver bow 520 

Comes with Diana, aims his silent shafts, 
And slays them. There two cities stand, and share 



62 1 he Odyssey. 

The isle between them. There my father reigned, 

The godlike Ctesias, son of Ormenus, 

And both the cities owned him as their king. 5*5 

" There came a crew of that seafaring race, 
The people of Phoenicia, to our isle. 
Shrewd fellows they, and brought in their black 

ship 
Large store of trinkets. In my father's house 
Was a Phoenician woman, large and fair, 530 

And skilful in embroidery. As she came 
A laundress to their ship, those cunning men 
Seduced her. One of them obtained her love, — 
For oft doth love mislead weak womankind, 
Even of the more discreet. Her paramour 535 

Asked who she was, and whence. She pointed out 
The lofty pile in which my father dwelt. 

" ' At Sidon, rich in brass, I had my birth, — 
A daughter of the opulent Arybas ; 
And once, as I was coming from the fields, 540 

The Taphian pirates seized and bore me off, 
And brought me to this isle and sold me here, 
At that man's house ; much gold he paid for me.' 

"Then said her paramour : 'Wilt thou not then 
Return with us, that thou mayst see again 545 

Father and mother, and their fair abode ? 
For yet they live, and rumor says are rich.' 

"To this the woman answered : ' I consent 
If first ye take an oath, — ye mariners, — 
And pledge your faith to bear me safely home.' 539 



Book XV. 63 

"She spake, and they complied, and when the 
oath 
Was duly taken, thus the woman said : — 

" ' Now hold your peace ; let none of all the crew 
Speak to me more, in meeting on the road 
Or at the fountain, lest some one should tell 55s 

The old man at the house, and he suspect 
Some fraud and bind me fast, and plot your death. 
Lock up your words within your breast ; make haste 
To buy supplies, and when the ship is full 
Of all things needful, let a messenger 560 

Come to me at the palace with all speed ; 
And I will bring with me whatever gold 
My hands may find, and something else to pay 
My passage. I am nurse to the young heir 
Of the good man who dwells in yonder halls, — 565 
A shrewd boy for his years, who oft goes out 
With me, — and I will lead him to the ship, 
And he will bring, in any foreign land 
To which ye carry him, a liberal price/ 

" The woman spake, and to our fair abode 570 
Departed. The Phoenician crew remained 
Until the twelvemonth's end, and filled their ship 
With many things, and, when its roomy hull 
Was fully laden, sent a messenger 
To tell the woman. He, a cunning man, 575 

Came to my father's house, and brought with him 
A golden necklace set with amber beads. 
The palace maidens and the gracious queen, 



64 The Odyssey. 

My mother, took it in their hands, and gazed 

Upon it, and debated of its price. 580 

Meantime the bearer gave the sign, and soon 

Departed to the ship. The woman took 

My hand and led me forth. Within the hall 

She found upon the tables ready placed 

The goblets for my father's guests, his peers ; s*» 

But they were absent, and in council yet 

Amid a great assembly. She concealed 

Three goblets in her bosom, and bore off 

The theft. I followed thoughtlessly. The sun 

Went down, and darkness brooded o'er the ways. 59- 

Briskly we walked, and reached the famous port 

And the fast-sailing ship. They took us both 

On board, and sailed. Along its ocean path 

The vessel ran, and Jupiter bestowed 

A favorable wind. Six days we sailed, 59s 

Both night and day ; but when Saturnian Jove 

Brought the seventh day, Diana, archer-queen, 

Struck down the woman, and with sudden noise 

Headlong she plunged into the hold, as dives 

A sea-gull. But the seamen cast her forth &» 

To fishes and to sea-calves. I was left 

Alone and sorrowful. The winds and waves 

Carried our galley on to Ithaca ; 

And there Laertes purchased me, and thus 

I first beheld the land in which I dwell." ** 

And then again the great Ulysses spake : 
" Eumaeus, the sad story of thy wrongs 



Book XV. 65 

And sufferings moves me deeply ; yet hath Jove 

Among thy evil fortunes given this good, 

That, after all thy sufferings, thou art lodged exo 

With a good master, who abundantly 

Provides thee meat and drink ; thou leadest here 

A pleasant life, while I am corae to thee 

From wandering long and over many lands." 

So talked they with each other. No long time 615 
They passed in sleep, for soon the Morning came, 
Throned on her car of gold. Beside the shore 
The comrades of Telemachus cast loose 
The sails, took down the mast, and with their oars 
Brought in the vessel to its place. They threw 6*> 
The anchors out and bound the hawsers fast, 
And went upon the sea-beach, where they dressed 
Their morning meal, and mingled purple wine. 
Then, when the calls of thirst and hunger ceased, 
Discreet Telemachus bespake the crew : — e as 

" Take the black ship to town. I visit first 
The fields, and see my herdsmen, and at eve 
Will come to town. To-morrow I will give 
The parting feast, rich meats and generous wine." 

Then said the godlike Theoclymenus : 630 

" Whither, my son, am I to go ? What house 
Of all the chiefs of rugged Ithaca 
Shall I seek shelter in ? with thee, perhaps, 
In thine own palace where thy mother dwells." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 635 

" I would have asked thee at another time 



66 The Odyssey. 

To make our house thy home, for there would be 

No lack of kindly welcome. 'T were not well 

To ask thee now, for I shall not be there, 

Nor will my mother see thee, — since not oft e 4 o 

Doth she appear before the suitor-train, 

But in an upper room, apart from them, 

Weaves at her loom a web. Another man 

I name, Eurymachus, the illustrious son 

Of the sage Polybus, to be thy host. 645 

The noblest of the suitors he, and seeks 

Most earnestly to wed the queen, and take 

The rank Ulysses held. Olympian Jove, 

Who dwells in ether, knows the fatal day 

That may o'ertake the suitors ere she wed." e S o 

As thus he spake, a falcon on the right 
Flew by, Apollo's messenger. A dove 
Was in his talons, which he tore, and poured 
The feathers down between Telemachus 
And where the galley lay. When this was seen 6 53 
By Theoclymenus, he called the youth 
Apart, alone, and took his hand and said : — 

" The bird that passed us, O Telemachus, 
Upon the right, flew not without a god 
To guide him. When I saw it ; well I knew 660 

The omen. Not in Ithaca exists 
A house of a more kingly destiny 
Than thine, and ever will its power prevail." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 
* O stranger, may thy saying come to pass : ^ 



Book XV. 67 

Then shalt thou quickly know me for thy friend, 

A.nd be rewarded with such liberal gifts 

That all who meet thee shall rejoice with thee." 

Then turning to Piraeus he bespake 
That faithful follower thus : " Pirseus, son e 7 o 

Of Clytius, thou who ever wert the first 
To move, at my command, of all the men 
Who went with me to Pylos, take, I pray, 
This stranger to thy house, and there provide 
For him, and honor him until I come." 5 75 

Pirseus, mighty with the spear, replied : 
u Telemachus, however long thy stay, 
This man shall be my guest, nor ever lack 
Beneath my roof for hospitable care." 

He spake, and climbed the deck, and bade his 
men eso 

Enter the ship and cast the fastenings loose. 
Quickly they came together, went on board 
And manned the benches, while Telemachus 
Bound the fair sandals to his feet, and took 
His massive spear with its sharp blade of brass 685 
That lay upon the deck. The men unbound 
The hawsers, shoved the galley forth, and sailed 
Townward, as they were bidden by the son 
Of great Ulysses. Meantime the quick feet 
Of the young chieftain bore him on until 690 

He reached the lodge where his great herds of swine 
Were fed, and, careful of his master's wealth, 
Beside his charge the worthy swineherd slept.
