			<p>
<span>Tell me, O Muse, of that sagacious man</span>
<br/>
<span>Who, having overthrown the sacred town</span>
<br/>
<span>Of Ilium, wandered far and visited</span>
<br/>
<span>The capitals of many nations, learned</span>
<br/>
<span>The customs of their dwellers, and endured</span>
<br/>
<span>Great suffering on the deep: his life was oft</span>
<br/>
<span>In peril, as he labored to bring back</span>
<br/>
<span>His comrades to their homes. He saved them not,</span>
<br/>
<span>Though earnestly he strove; they perished all,</span>
<br/>
<span>Through their own folly; for they banqueted,</span>
<br/>
<span>Madmen! upon the oxen of the Sun,—</span>
<br/>
<span>The all-o'erlooking Sun, who cut them off</span>
<br/>
<span>From their return. O goddess, virgin-child</span>
<br/>
<span>Of Jove, relate some part of this to me.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Now all the rest, as many as escaped</span>
<br/>
<span>The cruel doom of death, were at their homes</span>
<br/>
<span>Safe from the perils of the war and sea,</span>
<br/>
<span>While him alone, who pined to see his home</span>
<br/>
<span>And wife again, Calypso, queenly nymph,</span>
<br/>
<span>Great among goddesses, detained within</span>
<br/>
<span>Her spacious grot, in hope that he might yet</span>
<br/>
<span>Become her husband. Even when the years</span>
<br/>
<span>Brought round the time in which the gods decreed</span>
<br/>
<span>That he should reach again his dwelling-place</span>
<br/>
<span>In Ithaca, though he was with his friends,</span>
<br/>
<span>His toils were not yet ended. Of the gods</span>
<br/>
<span>All pitied him save Neptune, who pursued</span>
<br/>
<span>With wrath implacable the godlike chief,</span>
<br/>
<span>Ulysses, even to his native land.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Among the Ethiopians was the god</span>
<br/>
<span>Far off,—the Ethiopians most remote</span>
<br/>
<span>Of men. Two tribes there are; one dwells beneath</span>
<br/>
<span>The rising, one beneath the setting sun.</span>
<br/>
<span>He went to grace a hecatomb of beeves</span>
<br/>
<span>And lambs, and sat delighted at the feast;</span>
<br/>
<span>While in the palace of Olympian Jove</span>
<br/>
<span>The other gods assembled, and to them</span>
<br/>
<span>The father of immortals and of men</span>
<br/>
<span>Was speaking. To his mind arose the thought</span>
<br/>
<span>Of that Aegisthus whom the famous son</span>
<br/>
<span>Of Agamemnon, Prince Orestes, slew.</span>
<br/>
<span>Of him he thought and thus bespake the gods:—</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>"How strange it is that mortals blame the gods</span>
<br/>
<span>And say that we inflict the ills they bear,</span>
<br/>
<span>When they, by their own folly and against</span>
<br/>
<span>The will of fate, bring sorrow on themselves!</span>
<br/>
<span>As late Aegisthus, unconstrained by fate,</span>
<br/>
<span>Married the queen of Atreus' son and slew</span>
<br/>
<span>The husband just returned from war. Yet well</span>
<br/>
<span>He knew the bitter penalty, for we</span>
<br/>
<span>Warned him. We sent the herald Argicide,</span>
<br/>
<span>Bidding him neither slay the chief nor woo</span>
<br/>
<span>His queen, for that Orestes, when he came</span>
<br/>
<span>To manhood and might claim his heritage,</span>
<br/>
<span>Would take due vengeance for Atrides slain.</span>
<br/>
<span>So Hermes said; his prudent words moved not</span>
<br/>
<span>The purpose of Aegisthus who now pays</span>
<br/>
<span>The forfeit of his many crimes at once."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, thus replied:—</span>
<br/>
<span>"O father, son of Saturn, king of kings!</span>
<br/>
<span>Well he deserved his death. So perish all</span>
<br/>
<span>Guilty of deeds like his! But I am grieved</span>
<br/>
<span>For sage Ulysses, that most wretched man,</span>
<br/>
<span>So long detained, repining, and afar</span>
<br/>
<span>From those he loves, upon a distant isle</span>
<br/>
<span>Girt by the waters of the central deep,—</span>
<br/>
<span>A forest isle, where dwells a deity</span>
<br/>
<span>The daughter of wise Atlas, him who knows</span>
<br/>
<span>The ocean to its utmost depths, and holds</span>
<br/>
<span>Upright the lofty columns which divide</span>
<br/>
<span>The earth from heaven. The daughter there detains</span>
<br/>
<span>The unhappy chieftain, and with flattering words</span>
<br/>
<span>Would win him to forget his Ithaca.</span>
<br/>
<span>Meanwhile, impatient to behold the smokes</span>
<br/>
<span>That rise from hearths in his own land, he pines</span>
<br/>
<span>And willingly would die. Is not thy heart,</span>
<br/>
<span>Olympics, touched by this? And did he not</span>
<br/>
<span>Pay grateful sacrifice to thee beside</span>
<br/>
<span>The Argive fleet in the broad realm of Troy?</span>
<br/>
<span>Why then, O Jove, art thou so wroth with him?"</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Then answered cloud-compelling Jove: "My child,</span>
<br/>
<span>What words have passed thy lips? Can I forget</span>
<br/>
<span>Godlike Ulysses, who in gifts of mind</span>
<br/>
<span>Excels all other men, and who has brought</span>
<br/>
<span>Large offerings to the gods that dwell in heaven?</span>
<br/>
<span>Yet he who holds the earth in his embrace,</span>
<br/>
<span>Neptune, pursues him with perpetual hate</span>
<br/>
<span>Because of Polypheme, the Cyclops, strong</span>
<br/>
<span>Beyond all others of his giant race,</span>
<br/>
<span>Whose eye Ulysses had put out. The nymph</span>
<br/>
<span>Thoosa brought him forth,—a daughter she</span>
<br/>
<span>Of Phorcys, ruling in the barren deep,—</span>
<br/>
<span>And in the covert of o'erhanging rocks</span>
<br/>
<span>She met with Neptune. For this cause the god</span>
<br/>
<span>Who shakes the shores, although he slay him not,</span>
<br/>
<span>Sends forth Ulysses wandering far away</span>
<br/>
<span>From his own country. Let us now consult</span>
<br/>
<span>Together and provide for his return,</span>
<br/>
<span>And Neptune will lay by his wrath, for vain</span>
<br/>
<span>It were for one like him to strive alone</span>
<br/>
<span>Against the might of all the immortal gods."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>And then the blue-eyed Pallas spake again:—</span>
<br/>
<span>"O father! son of Saturn, king of kings!</span>
<br/>
<span>If such the pleasure of the blessed gods</span>
<br/>
<span>That now the wise Ulysses shall return</span>
<br/>
<span>To his own land, let us at once despatch</span>
<br/>
<span>Hermes, the Argicide, our messenger,</span>
<br/>
<span>Down to Ogygia, to the bright-haired nymph,</span>
<br/>
<span>And make our steadfast purpose known to bring</span>
<br/>
<span>The sufferer Ulysses to his home,</span>
<br/>
<span>And I will haste to Ithaca, and move</span>
<br/>
<span>His son, that with a resolute heart he call</span>
<br/>
<span>The long-haired Greeks togethefand forbid</span>
<br/>
<span>The excesses of the suitor train, who slay 

His flocks and slow-paced beeves with crooked 

horns. «s 

To Sparta I will send him and the sands 
Of Pylos, to inquire for the return 
Of his dear father. So a glorious fame 
Shall gather round him in the eyes of men." 

She spake, and fastened underneath her feet 120 
The fair, ambrosial golden sandals worn 
To bear her over ocean like the wind, 
And o'er the boundless land. In hand she took, 
Well tipped with trenchant brass, the mighty spear, 
Heavy and huge and strong, with which she bears 125 
Whole phalanxes of heroes to the earth, 
When she, the daughter of a mighty sire, 
Is angered. From the Olympian heights she 

plunged, 
And stood among the men of Ithaca, 
Just at the porch and threshold of their chief, iy 
Ulysses. In her hand she bore the spear, 
And seemed the stranger Mentes, he who led 



6 The Odyssey. 

The Taphians. There before the gate she found 
The haughty suitors. Some beguiled the time 134 
With draughts, while sitting on the hides of beeves 
Which they had slaughtered. Heralds were with 

them, 
And busy menials : some who in the bowls 
Tempered the wine with water, some who cleansed 
The tables with light sponges, and who set 
The banquet forth and carved the meats for all. 140 

Telemachus the godlike was the first 
To see the goddess as he sat among 
The crowd of suitors, sad at heart, and thought 
Of his illustrious father, who might come 
And scatter those who filled his palace halls, m? 
And win new honor, and regain the rule 
Over his own. As thus he sat and mused 
Among the suitors, he beheld where stood 
Pallas, and forth he sprang • he could not bear 
To keep a stranger waiting at his door. 150 

He came, and taking her right hand received 
The brazen spear, and spake these winged words : — 

" Hail, stranger ! thou art truly welcome here , 
First come and share our feast and be refreshed, 
Then say w r hat thou requirest at our hands." 15s 

He spake and led the way, and in his steps 
Pallas Athene followed. Entering then 
The lofty halls, he set the spear upright 
By a tall column, in the armory 
With polished walls, where rested many a lance »&> 



Book I. 7 

Of the large-souled Ulysses. Then he placed 

His guest upon a throne, o'er which he spread 

A covering many-hued and beautiful, 

And gave her feet a footstool. Near to her 

He drew his party-colored seat, aloof res 

From where the suitors sat ; that so hjs guest 

Might not amid those haughty revellers 

Be wearied with the tumult and enjoy 

His meal the less, and that himself might ask 

News of his absent father. In a bowl *n 

Of silver, from a shapely ewer of gold, 

A maid poured water for the hands, and set 

A polished table near them. Then approached 

A venerable matron bringing bread 

And delicacies gathered from the board ; 175 

And he who served the feast before them placed 

Chargers with various meats, and cups of gold ; 

While round the board a herald moved, and poured 

Wine for the guests. The haughty suitors now 

Came in, and took their places on the thrones 180 

And couches ; heralds poured upon their hands 

The water ; maidens heaped the canisters 

With bread, and all put forth their hands to share 

The banquet on the board, while to the brim 

Boys filled the beakers. When the calls of thirst f g 

And hunger were appeased, the suitors thought 

Of other things that well become a feast, — 

Song and the dance. And then a herald brought 

A shapely harp, and gave it to the hands 



8 The Odyssey. 

Of Phemius, who had only by constraint 190 

Sung to the suitors. On the chords he struck 
A prelude to his lay, while, as he played, 
Telemachus, that others might not hear, 
Leaned forward, and to blue-eyed Pallas spake : — 
" My friend and guest, wilt thou take no offence 19s 
At what I say ? These revellers enjoy 
The harp and song, for at no cost of theirs 
They waste the substance of another man, 
Whose white bones now are mouldering in the rain 
Upon some main-land, or are tossed about 200 

By ocean billows. Should they see him once 
In Ithaca, their prayers would rather rise 
For swifter feet than richer stores of gold 
And raiment. But an evil fate is his, 
And he has perished. Even should we hear ao 3 
From any of the dwellers upon earth 
That he is near at hand, we could not hope. 
For him is no return. But now, I pray, 
Tell me, and frankly tell me, who thou art, 
And of what race of men, and where thy home, «o 
And who thy parents ; how the mariners 
Brought thee to Ithaca, and who they claim 
To be, for well I deem thou couldst not come 
Hither on foot. All this, I pray, relate 
Truly, that I may know the whole. Art thou «« 
For the first time arrived, or hast thou been 
My father's guest ? for many a stranger once 
Resorted to our palace, and he knew 



Book I. 9 

The way to win the kind regard of men." 219 

Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, answered thus : — 
" I will tell all and truly. I am named 
Mentes ; my father was the great in war 
Anchialus. I rule a people skilled 
To wield the oar, the Taphians, and I come 
With ship and crew across the dark blue deep 225 
To Temese, and to a race whose speech 
Is different from my own, in quest of brass, 
And bringing bright steel with me. I have left 
Moored at the field behind the town my bark, 
Within the bay of Reithrus, and beneath 230 

The woods of Neius. We claim to be 
Guests by descent, and from our fathers' time, 
As thou wilt learn if thou shouldst meet and ask 
Laertes, the old hero. It is said 
He comes no more within the city walls, 23s 

But in the fields dwells sadly by himself, 
Where an old handmaid sets upon his board 
His food and drink when weariness unnerves 
His limbs in creeping o'er the fertile soil 
Of his rich vineyard. I am come because 240 

I heard thy father had at last returned, 
And now am certain that the gods delay 
His journey hither ; for the illustrious man 
Cannot have died, but is detained alone 
Somewhere upon the ocean, in some spot ms 

Girt by the waters. There do cruel men 
And savage keep him, pining to depart. 
1* 



IO The Odyssey. 

Now let me speak of what the gods reveal, 

And what I deem will surely come to pass, 

Although I am no seer and have no skill 230 

In omens drawn from birds. Not long the chief 

Will be an exile from his own dear land, 

Though fettered to his place by links of steel ; 

For he has large invention, and will plan 

A way for his escape. Now tell me this, 25s 

And truly ; tall in stature as thou art, 

Art thou in fact Ulysses' son ? In face 

And glorious eyes thou dost resemble him 

Exceedingly ; for he and I of yore 

Were oftentimes companions, ere he sailed 260 

For Ilium, whither also went the best 

Among the Argives in their roomy ships, 

Nor have we seen each other since that day." 

Telemachus, the prudent, spake : " O guest, 
True answer shalt thou have. My mother says 265 
I am his son ; I know not \ never man 
Knew his own father. Would I were the son 
Of one whose happier lot it was to meet 
Amidst his own estates the approach of age. 
Now the most wretched of the sons of men 270 

Is he to whom they say I owe my birth. 
Thus is thy question answered." Then again 
Spake blue-eyed Pallas : " Of a truth, the gods 
Ordain not that thy race, in years to come, 
Should be inglorious, since Penelope 275 

frlath borne thee such as I behold thee now. 



Book L n 

But frankly answer me, — what feast is here, 

And what is this assembly ? What may be 

The occasion ? is a banquet given ? is this 

A wedding ? A collation, where the guests 28c 

Furnish the meats, I think it cannot be, 

So riotously goes the revel on 

Throughout the palace. A well-judging man, 

If he should come among them, would be moved 

With anger at the shameful things they do." ■&*, 

Again Telemachus, the prudent, spake : — 
" Since thou dost ask me, stranger, know that once 
Rich and illustrious might this house be called 
While yet the chief was here. But now the gods 
Have grown unkind and willed it otherwise, 290 

They make his fate a mystery beyond 
The fate of other men. I should not grieve 
So deeply for his loss if he had fallen 
With his companions on the field of Troy, 
Or midst his kindred when the war was o'er. *x 
Then all the Greeks had built his monument, 
And he had left his son a heritage 
Of glory. Now has he become the prey 
Of Harpies, perishing ingloriously, 
Unseen, his fate unheard of, and has left ** 

Mourning and grief, my portion. Not for him 
Alone I grieve ; the gods have cast on me 
Yet other hardships. All the chiefs who rule 
The isles, Dulichium, Samos, and the groves 
That shade Zacynthus, and who bear the sway *% 



12 The Odyssey. 

In rugged Ithaca, have come to woo 

My mother, and from day to day consume 

My substance. She rejects not utterly 

Their hateful suit, and yet she cannot bear 

To end it by a marriage. Thus they waste 31 

My heritage, and soon will seek my life." 

Again in grief and anger Pallas spake : — 
" Yea, greatly dost thou need the absent chief 
Ulysses here, that he might lay his hands 
Upon these shameless suitors. Were he now 3* 
To come and stand before the palace gate 
With helm and buckler and two spears, as first 
I saw him in our house, when drinking wine 
And feasting, just returned from Ephyr^ 
Where Ilus dwelt, the son of Mermerus, — 32 

For thither went Ulysses in a bark, 
To seek a deadly drug with which to taint 
His brazen arrows ; Ilus gave it not \ 
He feared the immortal gods ; my father gave 
The poison, for exceedingly he loved 32; 

His guest, — could now Ulysses, in such guise, 
Once meet the suitors, short would be their lives 
And bitter would the marriage banquet be. 
Yet whether he return or not to take 
Vengeance, in his own palace, on this crew 33* 

Of wassailers, rests only with the gods. 
Now let me counsel thee to think betimes 
How thou shalt thrust them from thy palace gates. 
Observe me, and attend to what I say : 



Book L 13 

To-morrow thou shalt call the Achaian chiefs 335 

To an assembly ; speak before them all, 

And be the gods thy witnesses. Command 

The suitors all to separate for their homes ; 

And if thy mother's mind be bent to wed, 

Let her return to where her father dwells, 340 

A mighty prince, and there they will appoint 

Magnificent nuptials, and an ample dower 

Such as should honor a beloved child. 

And now, if thou wilt heed me, I will give 

A counsel for thy good. Man thy best ship 345 

With twenty rowers, and go forth to seek 

News of thy absent father. Thou shalt hear 

Haply of him from some one of the sons 

Of men, or else some word of rumor sent 

By Jove, revealing what mankind should know. x» 

First shape thy course for Pylos, and inquire 

Of noble Nestor ; then, at Sparta, ask 

Of fair-haired Menelaus, for he came 

Last of the mailed Achaians to his home. 

And shouldst thou learn that yet thy father lives, 355 

And will return, have patience yet a year, 

However hard it seem. But shouldst thou find 

That he is now no more, return forthwith 

To thy own native land, and pile on high 

His monument, and let the funeral rites 360 

Be sumptuously performed as may become 

The dead, and let thy mother wed again. 

And when all this is fully brought to pass, 



14 The Odyssey. 

Take counsel with thy spirit and thy heart 

How to destroy the suitor crew that haunt 365 

Thy palace, whether by a secret snare 

Or open force. No longer shouldst thou act 

As if thou wert a boy ; thou hast outgrown 

The age of childish sports. Hast thou not heard 

What honor the divine Orestes gained 370 

With all men, when he slew the murderer, 

The crafty wretch ^Egisthus, by whose hand 

The illustrious father of Orestes died ? 

And then, my friend, — for I perceive that thou 

Art of a manly and a stately growth, — ^75 

Be also bold, that men hereafter born 

May give thee praise. And now must I depart 

To my good ship, and to my friends who wait, 

Too anxiously perhaps, for my return. 

Act wisely now, and bear my words in mind/' 3a? 

The prudent youth Telemachus rejoined : — 
" Well hast thou spoken, and with kind intent 3 
O stranger ! like a father to a son ; 
And ne'er shall I forget what thou hast said. 
Yet stay, I pray thee, though in haste, and bathe 3*5 
And be refreshed, and take to thy good ship 
Some gift with thee, such as may please thee well, 
Precious and rare, which thou mayst ever keep 
In memory of me, — a gift like those 
Which friendly hosts bestow upon their guests." 39* 

Then spake the blue-eyed Pallas : " Stay me not, 
For now would I depart. Whatever gift 



Book L 15 

Thy heart may prompt thee to bestow, reserve 
Till I come back, that I may bear it home, 304 

And thou shalt take some precious thing in turn." 

So spake the blue-eyed Pallas, and withdrew, 
Ascending like a bird. She filled his heart 
With strength and courage, waking vividly 
His father's memory. Then the noble youth 
Went forth among the suitors. Silent all 400 

They sat and listened to the illustrious bard, 
Who sang of the calamitous return 
Of the Greek host from Troy, at the command 
Of Pallas. From her chamber o'er the hall 
The daughter of Icarius, the sage queen* 40s 

Penelope, had heard the heavenly strain, 
And knew its theme. Down by the lofty stairs 
She came, but not alone ; there followed her 
Two maidens. When the glorious lady reached 
The threshold of the strong-built hall, where sat 4* 
The suitors, holding up a delicate veil 
Before her face, and with a gush of tears, 
The queen bespake the sacred minstrel thus : — 

" Phemius ! thou knowest many a pleasing 
theme, — 
The deeds of gods and heroes, such as bards 41s 
Are wont to celebrate. Take then thy place 
And sing of one of these, and let the guests 
In silence drink the wine ; but cease this strain ; 
It is too sad ; it cuts me to the heart, 415 

And wakes a sorrow without bounds, — such grief 



1 6 The Odyssey. 

I bear for him, my lord, of whom I think 

Continually ; whose glory is abroad 

Through Hellas and through Argos, everywhere." 

And then Telemachus, the prudent, spake : — 
" Why, O my mother ! canst thou not endure v* 
That thus the well-graced poet should delight 
His hearers with a theme to which his mind 
Is inly moved ? The bards deserve no blame ; 
Jove is the cause, for he at will inspires 42? 

The lay that each must sing. Reprove not, then, 
The minstrel who relates the unhappy fate 
Of the Greek warriors. All men most applaud 
The song that has the newest theme ; and thou — 
Strengthen thy heart to hear it. Keep in mind 
That not alone Ulysses is cut off 435 

From his return, but that with him at Troy 
Have many others perished. Now withdraw 
Into thy chamber ; ply thy household tasks, 
The loom, the spindle ; bid thy maidens speed 
Their work. To say what words beseem a feast 440 
Belongs to man, and most to me • for here 
Within these walls the authority is mine." 

The matron, wondering at his words, withdrew 
To her own place, but in her heart laid up 444 

Her son's wise sayings. When she now had reached, 
With her attendant maids, the upper rooms, 
She mourned Ulysses, her beloved spouse, 
And wept, till blue-eyed Pallas closed her lids 
In gentle slumbers. Noisily, meanwhile, 



Book I. 17 

The suitors revelled in the shadowy halls ; 450 

And thus Telemachus, the prudent, spake : — 

" Ye suitors of my mother, insolent 
And overbearing ; cheerful be our feast, 
Not riotous. It would become us well 
To listen to the lay of such a bard, 45s 

So like the gods in voice. I bid you all 
Meet in full council with the morrow morn, 
That I may give you warning to depart 
From out my palace, and to seek your feasts 
Elsewhere at your own charge, — haply to hold 4& 
Your daily banquets at each other's homes. 
But if it seem to you the better way 
To plunder one man's goods, go on to waste 
My substance ; I will call the immortal gods 
To aid me, and if Jupiter allow 43 

Mt retribution for your deeds, ye die, 
Within this very palace, unavenged." 

He spake ; the suitors bit their close-pressed lips, 
Astonished at the youth's courageous words. 
And thus Antinoiis, Eupeithes' son, 47c 

Made answer : " Most assuredly the gods, 
Telemachus, have taught thee how to frame 
Grand sentences and gallantly harangue. 
Ne'er may the son of Saturn make thee king 
Over the sea-girt Ithaca, whose isle 475 

Is thy inheritance by claim of birth." 

Telemachus, the prudent, thus rejoined : — 
u Wilt thou be angry at the word I speak, 



1 8 The Odyssey. 

Antinoiis? I would willingly accept 

The kingly station if conferred by Jove. '*■ 

Dost thou indeed regard it as the worst 

Of all conditions of mankind ? Not so 

For him who reigns ; his house grows opulent, 

And he the more is honored. Many kings 

Within the bounds of sea-girt Ithaca m 

There are, both young and old, let any one 

Bear rule, since great Ulysses is no more ; 

But I will be the lord of mine own house, 

And o'er my servants whom the godlike chief, 

Ulysses, brought from war, his share of spoil." «* 

Euryraachus, the son of Polybus, 
Addressed the youth in turn : " Assuredly, 
What man hereafter, of the Achaian race, 
Shall bear the rule o'er sea-girt Ithaca m 

Rests with the gods. But thou shalt keep thy wealth, 
And may no son of violence come to make 
A spoil of thy possessions while men dwell 
In Ithaca. And now, my friend, I ask 
Who was thy guest ; whence came he, of what land 
Claims he to be, where do his kindred dwell, * 

And where his patrimonial acres lie? 
With tidings of thy father's near return

ts to be hoped no more ; nor can I trust 
Tidings from whatsoever part they come, s» 

Nor pay regard to oracles, although

Telemachus went up, and sought his couch, 
Intent on many thoughts. The chaste and sage 
Dame Eurycleia by his side went up 
With lighted torches, — she a child of Ops, 
Pisenor's son. Her, in her early bloom, 530 

Laertes purchased for a hundred beeves, 
And in his palace honored equally 
With his chaste wife ; yet never sought her bed. 
He would not wrong his queen. ' T was she who

Her young lord more than all the other maids, 
And she had nursed him in hit tender years. 
He opened now the chamber door and sat 
Upon the couch, put his soft tunic off 
And placed it in the prudent matron's hands. 
She folded it and smoothed it, hung it near 
To that fair bed, and, going quickly forth, 
Pulled at the silver ring to close the door, 
And drew the thong that moved the fastening bolt 
He, lapped in the soft fleeces, all night long. 
Thought of the voyage Pallas had ordained.
