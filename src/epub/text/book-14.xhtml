THEN from the haven up the rugged path 
Ulysses went among the woody heights. 
He sought the spot where Pallas bade him meet 
The noble swineherd, who of all that served 
The great Ulysses chiefly had in charge 
To bring the day's supplies. He found him there 
Seated beneath the portico, before 
His airy lodge, that might be seen from far, 



Book XIV. 21 

Well built and spacious, standing by itself. 

Eumaeus, while his lord was far away, » 

Had built it, though not bidden by the queen 

Nor old Laertes, with the stones he drew 

From quarries thither. Round it he had set 

A hedge of thorns, encircling these with stakes 

Close set and many, cloven from the heart is 

Of oak. Within that circuit he had made 

Twelve sties, beside each other, for the swine 

To lie in. Fifty wallowed in each sty, 

All females ; there they littered. But the males 

Were fewer, and were kept without ; and these » 

The suitor train made fewer every day, 

Feeding upon them, for Eumaeus sent 

Always the best of all his fatling herd. 

These numbered twice nine score. Beside them slept 

Four mastiffs, which the master swineherd fed, 25 

Savage as wolves. Eumaeus to his feet 

Was fitting sandals, which he carved and shaped 

From a stained ox-hide, while the other hinds 

Were gone on different errands, — three to drive 

The herds of swine, — a fourth was sent to take 30 

A fatling to the city, that the crew 

Of arrogant suitors, having offered him 

In sacrifice, might feast upon his flesh. 

The loud-mouthed dogs that saw Ulysses come 
Ran toward him, fiercely baying. He sat down 35 
At once, through caution, letting fall his staff 
Upon the ground, and would have suffered there 



22 The Odyssey. 

Unseemly harm, within his own domain, 
But then the swineherd, following with quick steps, 
Rushed through the vestibule, and dropped the hide. 
He chid the dogs and, pelting them with stones, 41 
Drave them asunder, and addressed the king : — 

" O aged man, the mastiffs of the lodge 
Had almost torn thee, and thou wouldst have cast 
Bitter reproach upon me. Other griefs 45 

And miseries the gods have made my lot. 
Here sorrowfully sitting I lament 
A godlike master, and for others tend 
His fading swine ; while, haply hungering 
For bread, he wanders among alien men 
In other kingdoms, if indeed he lives 
And looks upon the sun. But follow me, 
And come into the house, that there, refreshed 
With food and wine, old man, thou mayst declare 
Whence thou dost come and what thou hast en- 
dured." 55 

So the good swineherd spake, and led the way 
Into the lodge, and bade his guest sit down, 
And laid thick rushes for his seat, and spread 
On these a wild goat's shaggy hide to make 
A soft and ample couch. Rejoiced to meet &> 

So kind a welcome, thus Ulysses spake : — 

"May Jupiter and all the deathless gods 
Bestow on thee, my host, in recompense 
Of this kind welcome, all thy heart's desire ! " 

And then, Eumaeus, thou didst answer thus : 65 



Book XIV, 23 

x My guest, it were not right to treat with scorn 
A stranger, though he were of humbler sort 
Than thou, for strangers and the poor are sent 
By Jove ; our gifts are small, though gladly given, 
As it must ever be with those who serve 70 

Young masters, whom they fear. The gods them- 
selves 
Prevent, no doubt,- the safe return of him 
Who loved me much, and would ere this have given 
What a kind lord is wont to give his hind, — 
A house, a croft, the wife whom he has wooed, 75 
Rewarding faithful services which God 
Hath prospered, as he here hath prospered mine. 
Thus would my master, had he here grown old, 
Have recompensed my toils ; but he is dead. 
O that the house of Helen, for whose sake ^ 

So many fell, had perished utterly ! 
For he went forth at Agamemnon's call, 
Honoring the summons, and on Ilium's coast, 
Famed for its coursers, fought the sons of Troy.'* 

He spake, and girt his tunic round his loins, s 3 
And hastened to the sties in which the herds 
Of swine were lying. Thence he took out two 
A-nd slaughtered them, and singed them, sliced the 

flesh, 
And fixed it upon spits, and, when the whole 
Was roasted, brought and placed it reeking hot, <*> 
Sdll on the spits and sprinkled with white meal, 
Before Ulysses. Then he mingled wine 



24 1h e Odyssey. 

Of delicate flavors in a wooden bowl, 
And opposite Ulysses sat him down, 
And thus with kindly words bespake his guest : — 95 
" Feast, stranger, on these porkers. We who serve 
May feed on them ; it is the suitor train 
That banquet on the fatted swine, — the men 
Who neither fear heaven's anger nor are moved 
By pity. The great gods are never pleased 100 

With violent deeds ; they honor equity 
And justice. Even those who land as foes 
And spoilers upon foreign shores, and bear 
Away much plunder by the will of Jove, 
Returning homeward with their laden barks, 10s 
Feel, brooding heavily upon their minds, 
The fear of vengeance. But these suitors know — 
For haply they have heard some god declare — 
That he, the king, is dead ; they neither make 
Their suit with decency, nor will withdraw i» 

To their own homes, but at their ease devour 
His substance with large waste, and never spare. 
Of all the days and nights which Jupiter 
Gives to mankind is none when they require 
A single victim only, or but two, «j 

For sacrifice, and lavishly they drain 
His wine-jars. Once large revenues were his. 
No hero on the dark-soiled continent 
Nor in the isle of Ithaca possessed 
Such wealth as he, nor even twenty- men » 

Together. Hear me while I give the amount. 



Book XIV. 25 

Twelve herds of kine that on the mainland graze 

Are his, as many flocks of sheep, of swine 

As many droves ; as many flocks of goats 

Are tended there by strangers, and by hinds, ws 

His servants. Here moreover, in the fields 

Beyond us, graze eleven numerous flocks 

Of goats, attended by his trusty men, 

Each one of whom brings daily home a goat, 

The finest of the fatlings. I meantime 130 

Am keeper of these swine, and from the drove 

I choose and to the palace send the best." 

So spake the swineherd, while Ulysses ate 
The flesh with eager appetite, and drank 
The wine in silence, meditating woe 13s 

To all the suitors. When the meal was o'er, 
And he was strengthened by the food, his host 
Filled up with wine the cup from which he drank. 
And gave it to Ulysses, who, well pleased, 
Received it, and with winged words replied : — 140 

" What rich and mighty chief was he, my friend, 
Of whom thou speakest, and who purchased thee ? 
Thou sayest that he died to swell the fame 
Of Agamemnon. Tell his name, for I 
Perchance know somewhat of him. Jupiter 145 

And the great gods know whether I have seen 
The man, and have some tidings for thy ear ; 
For I have wandered over many lands." 

And then again the noble swineherd spake : 
* O aged man, no wanderer who should bring i&

26 The Odyssey. 

News of Ulysses e'er would win his wife 
And son to heed the tale. For roving men, 
In need of hospitality, are prone 
To falsehood, and will never speak the truth. 
The vagabond who comes to Ithaca 
Goes straightway to my mistress with his lies. 
Kindly she welcomes him, and cherishes 
And questions him, while tears abundantly 
Fall from her lids, — such tears as women shed 
Whose lords have perished in a distant land. 
Thou too, old man, perchance, couldst readily 
Frame a like fable, if some one would give 
A change of raiment for thy news, — a cloak 
And tunic. But the dogs and fowls of air 
Have doubtless fed upon the frame from which 
The life has passed, and torn from off his bones 
The skin, or fishes of the deep have preyed 
Upon it, and his bones upon the shore 
Lie whelmed in sand. So is he lost to us, 
And sorrow is the lot of all his friends, 
Mine most of all ; for nowhere shall I find 
So kind a master, though I were to come 
Into my father's and my mother's house, 
Where I was born and reared. Nor do I pine 
So much to look on them with my own eyes, 
And in my place of birth, as I lament 
Ulysses lost. Though he be far away, 
Yet must I ever speak, O stranger guest, 
His name with reverence, for exceedingly 



Book XIV. 27 

He loved me and most kindly cared for me ; i&> 
And though he is to be with us no more, 
I hold him as an elder brother still." 

Ulysses, the great sufferer, thus replied : 
" Since then, my friend, thou dost not say nor think 
That he will come again, nor wilt believe 185 

My words, I now repeat, but with an oath, 
Ulysses will return. Let this reward 
Be given for my good news : the very hour 
When he once more is in his house, bestow 
On me a comely change of raiment, — cloak 190 

And tunic, — nor will I accept the gift, 
Though great my need, until he comes again. 
For as the gates of hell do I detest 
The man who. tempted by his poverty, 
Deceives with lying words. Now Jupiter 19s 

Bear witness, and this hospitable board 
And hearth of good Ulysses where I sit, 
That all which I foretell will come to pass. 
This very year Ulysses will return. 
He, when this month goes out, and as the next » 
Is entering, will be here in his domain, 
To be avenged on those, whoe'er they be, 
That dare insult his wife and noble son." 

And then, Eumaeus, thou didst answer thus : 
" Old man, I shall not give thee that reward, 20s 
For never will Ulysses come again 
To his own palace. Drink thy wine in peace, 
And let us give our thoughts to other things. 



28 The Odyssey. 

Remind me not of this again ; my heart 

Grows heavy in my bosom when I hear :» 

My honored master named. But leave the oath 

Unsworn, and may Ulysses come, as we 

Earnestly wish, — I and Penelope, 

And old Laertes, and the godlike youth 

Telemachus. And then, again, I bear sis 

Perpetual sorrow for Telemachus, 

My master's son, to whom the gods had given 

A generous growth like that of some young plant, 

And who, I hoped, would prove no less in worth 

Than his own father, and of eminent gifts 220 

In form and mind. Some god, perchance some man, 

Hath caused that mind to lose its equal poise, 

And he is gone to Pylos the divine 

For tidings of his father. Meanwhile here 

The arrogant suitors plan to lie in wait 22s 

For him as he returns, that utterly 

The stock of great Arcesius from our isle 

May perish, and its name be heard no more. 

Speak we no more of him, be it his fate 

To fall or flee ; but O, may Saturn's son =30 

Protect him with his arm ! And now, old man, 

Relate, I pray, thy fortunes ; tell me true, 

That I may know who thou mayst be, and whence 

Thou earnest, where thy city lies, and who 

Thy parents were, what galley landed thee =35 

Upon our coast, and how the manners 

Brought thee to Ithaca, and of what race 



Book XIV. 29 

They claim to be ; for I may well suppose 
Thou hast not come to Ithaca on foot." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered him : 24c 

" I will tell all and truly. Yet if here 
Were store of food, and wine for many days, 
And we might feast at ease within thy lodge 
While other labored, I should hardly end 
In a whole year the history of the woes 245 

Which I have borne, and of the many toils 
Which it hath pleased the gods to lay on me. 

" It is my boast that I am of the race 
Who dwell in spacious Crete, a rich man's son, 
Within whose palace many other sons «s<» 

Were born and reared, the offspring of his wife ; 
But me a purchased mother whom he made 
His concubine brought forth to him. And yet 
Castor Hylacides, from whom I sprang, 
Held me in equal favor with the rest ; 2 SS 

And he himself was honored like a god 
Among the Cretan people, for his wealth 
And for his prosperous life and gallant sons. 
But fate and death o'ertook and bore him down 
To Pluto's realm, and his magnanimous sons 260 
Divided his large riches, casting lots. 
Small was the portion they assigned to me ; 
They gave a dwelling, but my valor won 
A bride, the daughter of a wealthy house, — 
For I was not an idler, nor in war 265 

A coward ; but all that is with the past. 



30 The Odyssey. 

And thou, who seest the stubble now, mayst guess 

What was the harvest, ere calamities 

Had come so thick upon me. Once did Mars 

And Pallas lend me courage, and the power 270 

To break through ranks of armed men. Whene'er 

I formed an ambush of the bravest chiefs, 

And planned destruction to the enemy, 

My noble spirit never set the fear 

Of death before me ; I was ever first 27s 

To spring upon the foes, and with my spear 

To smite them as they turned their steps to flee. 

Such was I once in war; to till the fields 

I never liked, nor yet the household cares 

By which illustrious sons are reared. I loved &* 

Ships well appointed, combats, polished spears 

And arrows. Things that others hold in dread 

Were my delight ; some god inclined to them 

My mind, — so true it is that different men 

Rejoice in different labors. Ere the sons 285 

Of Greece embarked for Troy, I served in war 

Nine times as leader against foreign foes, 

With troops and galleys under me, and then 

I prospered ; from the mass of spoil I chose 

The things that pleased me, and obtained by lot =9» 

Still other treasures. Thus my household grew 

In riches, and I was revered and great 

Among the Cretans. When all-seeing Jove 

Decreed the unhappy voyage to the coast 

Of Troy, they made the great Idomeneus *& 



Book XIV. 31 

And me commanders of the fleet. No power 

Had we — the public clamor was so fierce — 

To put the charge aside. Nine years we warred, — 

We sons of Greece, — and in the tenth laid waste 

The city of Priam, and embarked for home. 300 

Our fleets were scattered by the gods. For me 

Did all-disposing Jupiter ordain 

A wretched lot. But one short month I dwelt 

Happy among my children, with the wife 

Wedded to me in youth, and my large wealth. 3°?, 

And then I planned a voyage to the coast 

Of Egypt, with a gallant fleet, and men 

Of godlike valor. I equipped nine ships, 

And quickly came the people to embark. 

Six days on shore my comrades banqueted, 310 

And many a victim for the sacrifice 

And for the feast I gave ; the seventh we sailed 

From Crete's broad isle before a favoring wind 

That blew from the clear north, and easily 

We floated on as down a stream. No ship 315 

Was harmed upon its way ; in health and ease 

We sat, the wind and helmsmen guiding us, 

And came upon the fifth day to the land 

Of Egypt, watered by its noble streams. 

I bade my comrades keep beside our ships 320 

Upon the strand, and watch them well. I placed 

Sentries upon the Heights. Yet confident 

In their own strength, and rashly giving way 

To greed, my comrades ravaged the fair fields 



32 The Odyssey. 

Of the Egyptians, slew them, and bore off 325 

Their wives and little ones. The rumor reached 
The city soon ; the people heard the alarm 
And came together. With the early morn 
All the great plain was thronged with horse and foot, 
And gleamed with brass ; while Jove, the Thun- 
derer, sent 330 
A deadly fear into our ranks, where none 
Dared face the foe. On every side was death. 
The Egyptians hewed down many with the sword, 
And some they led away alive to toil 
For them in slavery. To my mind there came 
A thought, inspired by Jove ; yet I could wish 
That I had met my fate, and perished there 
In Egypt, such have been my sorrows since. 
I took the well-wrought helmet from my head, 
And from my shoulders dropped the shield, and 

flung 
The javelin from my hand, and went to meet 
The monarch in his chariot, clasped his knees 
And kissed them. He was moved to pity me, 
And spared me. In his car he seated me, 
And bore me weeping home. Though many rushed 
At me with ashen spears, to thrust me through, — 34* 
For furious was their anger, — he forbade. 
He feared the wrath of Jove, the stranger's friend 
And foe of wrong. Seven years I dwelt among 
The Egyptians, and I gathered in their land 3 

Large wealth, for all were liberal of their gifts. 



Book XIV. 33 

But with the eighth revolving year there came 
A shrewd Phoenician, deep in guile, whose craft 
Had wrought much wrong to many. With smooth 

words 
This man persuaded me to go with him 355 

Into Phoenicia, where his dwelling lay 
And his possessions. With him I abode 
For one whole year ; and when its months and days 
Were ended, and another year began, 
He put me in a ship to cross the sea **> 

To Lybia. He had framed a treacherous plot, 
By making half the vessel's cargo mine, 
To lure me thither, and to sell me there 
For a large price. I went on board constrained, 
But with misgivings. Under a clear sky, 36s 

With favoring breezes from the north, we ran 
O'er the mid sea, beyond the isle of Crete. 
When we had left the isle, and saw no land 
But only sky and sea, Saturnius bade 
A black cloud gather o'er our roomy ship. 370 

The sea grew dark below. On high the God 
Thundered again and yet again, and sent 
A bolt into our ship, which, as it felt 
The lightning, reeled and shuddered, and was filled 
With sulphur-smoke. The seamen from the deck 375 
Fell headlong, and were tossed upon the waves 
Like seamews round our galley, which the God 
Forbade them to regain. But Jupiter 
Gave to my hands, bewildered as I was, 
2* 



34 The Odyssey. 

Our dark-prowed galley's mast, unbroken yet, #• 

That by its aid I might escape. I wound 

My arms around it, and the raging winds 

Swept me along. Nine days they bore me on, 

And on the tenth dark night a mighty surge 

Drifted me, as it rolled, upon the coast 385 

Of the Thesprotians. There the hero-king 

Of the Thesprotians freely sheltered me 

And fed me ; for his well-beloved son 

Had found me overcome with cold and toil, 

And took me by the hand and raised me up, 3* 

And led me to his father's house, and gave 

Seemly attire, a tunic and a cloak. 

" There heard I of Ulysses. Pheidon told 
How he received him as a guest and friend, 
When on his homeward voyage. Then he showed 39} 
The wealth Ulysses gathered, brass and gold, 
And steel divinely wrought. That store might serve 
To feed, until ten generations pass, 
Another household. But the chief himself, 
So Pheidon said, was at Dodona then ; «» 

For he had gone to hear from the tall oak 
Of Jupiter the counsel of the God, 
Whether to land in opulent Ithaca, 
After long years of absence, openly 
Or in disguise. The monarch took an oath 403 

In his own palace, pouring to the gods 
Their wine, that even then the ship was launched, 
And the crew ready to attend him home. 



Book XIV. 35 

But me he first dismissed. There was a ship 

Of the Thesprotians just about to make 4ic 

A voyage to Dulichium, rich in fields 

Of wheat. He bade them take me faithfully 

To King Acastus ; but another thought 

Found favor with the crew, a wicked scheme 

To plunge me deeper in calamity. 415 

And when our ship had sailed away from land, 

They hastened to prepare me for a life 

Of slavery. They took my garments off, 

Mantle and cloak, and clothed me in a vest 

And cloak, the very rags which thou dost see. 420 

The evening brought them to the pleasant fields 

Of Ithaca. They bound me in the ship 

With a strong cord, and disembarked, and took 

A hasty meal upon the ocean-side ; 

Easily did the gods unbind my limbs. 42s 

I wrapped a tattered cloth about my head, 

And, slipping from the polished rudder, brought 

My bosom to the sea, and spread my hands, 

And swam away. I soon had left the crew 

At distance ; then I turned and climbed the shore, 430 

Where it was dark with forest, and lay close 

Within its shelter, while they wandered round 

And grumbled, but they ventured not to pass 

Into the island farther on their search. 

They turned, and went on board their roomy bark. 435 

Thus mightily the gods delivered me, 

Andthey have brought me to a wise man's lodge, 



36 The Odyssey. 

And now I see it is my lot to live." 

Then thou, Eumaeus, thus didst make reply : 
u Unhappy stranger, thou hast deeply moved *4a 
My heart in telling all that thou hast borne, 
And all thy wanderings. Yet are some things wrong. 
Thou hast not spoken of Ulysses well. 
Why should a man like thee invent such tales, 
So purposeless ? Of one thing I am sure «s 

Concerning his return, — the gods all hate 
My master, since they neither caused his death 
In the great war of Troy, nor, when the war 
Was over, suffered him to die at home, 
And in the arms of those who loved him most ; 45c 
For then would all the Greeks have reared to him 
A monument, and mighty would have been 
The heritage of glory for his son ; 
But now ingloriously the harpy brood 
Have torn him. I, apart among my swine, 455 

Go never to the town, unless, perchance, 
The sage Penelope requires me there, 
When some one comes with tidings from abroad. 
Then those who sorrow for their absent lord, 
And those who waste his substance, both inquire & 
News of the king. For me, it suits me not 
Ever to ask for tidings, since the day 
When an ^Etolian with a flattering tale 
Deceived me. He had slain a man, and came 
Wandering in many lands to my abode, 465 

And kindly I received him. He bad seen, 



Book XIV. 37 

He said, my master with Idomeneus, 
Among the Cretans, putting in repair 
His galleys, shattered by a furious storm, 
And in the summer time he would be here, 4?a 

Or in the autumn, bringing ample wealth, 
And his brave comrades with him. Seek not then, 
O aged sufferer, whom some deity 
Has guided hither, to amuse my grief 
With fictions that may bring back pleasant 
thoughts, 47. 

Since not for them I minister to thee 
And love thee, but through reverence for Jove, — 
The stranger's friend, — and pity for thyself." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, spake again : 
"Within thy bosom thou dost bear a heart ^ 

Of slow belief, since not the oath I take 
Persuades or even moves thee. Make we now 
A covenant, and let the gods who dwell 
Upon Olympus be our witnesses, 
That when thy master comes to this abode 4S» 

Thou wilt bestow a tunic and a cloak, 
And wilt despatch me clothed in seemly garb 
Hence to Dulichium, whither I would go. 
But if he come not as I have foretold, 
Then charge thy servants that they cast me down 49a 
From a tall rock, that never beggar more 
May think to cozen thee with lying tales." 

The noble swineherd answered him and said : 
% Great would my honor be, and I should gain 



38 The Odyssey. 

Great praise for worth among the sons of men, *>$ 

If, having welcomed thee into my lodge 

And spread the board for thee, I took thy life ; 

Then boldly might I pray to Saturn's son. 

But see, the supper hour is come, and soon 

Will my companions be within, and they 500 

Will make a liberal banquet ready here." 

Thus did the twain confer. Now came the swine, 
And those who tended them. They penned the herd 
In their enclosure, and a din of cries 
Rose as they entered. Then the swineherd called 505 
To his companions : " Bring the best of all, 
And we will make an offering for the sake 
Of one who comes from far and is my guest. 
And we will also feast, for we have toiled 
Long time in tendance of this white-toothed herd, s«> 
And others waste, unpunished, what we rear." 

So spake he, and began to cleave the wood 
With the sharp steel ; the others chose and brought 
A fatted brawn, and placed him on the hearth. 
Nor was the swineherd careless of the rites 515 

Due to the gods, — such was his piety. 
From off the white-toothed victim first he sheared 
The bristles of the forehead, casting them 
Into the flames, and prayed to all the gods 
For wise Ulysses and his safe return. 5* 

Next, with a fragment of the oaken trunk 
Which he had just then cleft, he smote the boar, 
And the life left it. Then they cut its throat, 



Book XIV. 39 

And, having singed it, quickly hewed the parts 

Asunder, while the swineherd took and laid, s=s 

On the rich fat, raw portions from the limbs 

For sacrifice, and other parts he cast, 

Sprinkled with flour of meal, into the flames ; 

The rest they duly sliced and fixed on spits, 

And roasted carefully, and drew it back, s* 

And heaped it on the board. And now arose 

The swineherd to divide the whole, for well 

He knew the duty of a host. He made 

Seven parts ; and one he offered to the Nymphs, 

To Hermes, son of Maia, one, and both 53s 

With prayer ; the rest he set before the guests, 

But, honoring Ulysses, gave to him 

The white-toothed victim's ample chine. The king, 

The wise Ulysses, was well pleased, and said : — 

" Eumaeus, be thou ever dear to Jove m« 

As to myself, since with thy benefits 
Thou freely honorest such a one as I." 

And thou, Eumaeus, madest answer thus : 
" Eat, venerable stranger, and enjoy 
What is before us. At his pleasure God ks 

Gives or withholds ; his power is over all." 

He spake, and burned to the eternal gods 
The firstlings, and poured out the dark red wine, 
And to Ulysses, spoiler of walled towns, 
Who sat beside the table, gave the cup. ss° 

Meantime to each Mesaulius brought the bread, — 
A servant whom Eumaeus, while his lord 



40 The Odyssey. 

Was far away, had taken for himself, 

Without the order of Penelope 

Or old Laertes ; from the Taphian tribe sss 

With his own goods he bought him. Now the guests 

Put forth their hands and shared the ready feast ; 

And when their thirst and hunger were appeased 

Mesaulius took the bread away, and all, 

Satiate with food and wine, lay down to rest. 560 

Then came the darkness on, without a moon ; 
And Jupiter the whole night long sent down 
The rain, and strong the showery west-wind blew. 
And now to try the swineherd, if with all 
His kindly ministrations to his guest 56s 

He yet would spare to him his cloak, or bid 
Another do the like, Ulysses spake : — 

" Eumaeus, hearken thou, and all the rest, 
Thy comrades, while I utter boastful words. 
Wine makes me foolish, it can even cause 570 

The wise to sing and laugh a silly laugh 
And dance, and often to the lips it brings 
Words that were better left unsaid. But since 
I have begun to prattle, I will not 
Keep back my thought. I would I were as young 57s 
And in the same full strength as when I formed 
Part of an ambush near the walls of Troy. 
The leaders were Ulysses, and the son 
Of Atreus, Menelaus, with myself 
The third, for they desired it. When we reached 580 
The city and the lofty walls we lay 



Book XIV. 41 

Couched in a marshy spot among the reeds 
And thick-grown shrubs, with all our armor on. 
*T was an inclement night, and the north- wind 
Blew bitter chill, the cold snow fell and lay 5* 

White like hoar-frost ; ice gathered on our shields. 
The rest had cloaks and tunics, and they slept 
At ease, their shoulders covered with their shields. 
I only, when I joined the squadron, left 
My cloak unwisely, for I had not thought 590 

Of such fierce cold. I went but with my shield 
And my embroidered girdle. When the night 
Was in its later watches, and the stars 
Were turning toward their set, I thus bespake 
Ulysses near me, thrusting in his side 59s 

My elbow, and he listened readily : — 

" * Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise ! 
Ulysses, I shall not be long among 
The living ; for I perish with the cold. 
I have no cloak ; some god misled my thought, 600 
So that I brought one garment and no more, 
And now I see there is no help for me.' 

" I spake, and instantly his mind conceived 
This stratagem, — such was his readiness 
In council and in battle, — and he said 605 

To me in a low voice : ' Be silent now, 
And let no others of the Achaians hear ! ' 
And leaning on his elbow thus he spake : — 

" ' Hear me, my friends : a dream has come from 
heaven 



42 The Odyssey. 

Into my sleep. Far from our ships we lie ; *x 

And now let some one haste to bear from us 
This word to Agamemnon, Atreus' son, 
The shepherd of the people, that he send 
More warriors to this ambush from the fleet.' 

" He spake, and Thoas instantly arose, — ^s 
Andraemon's son, — and threw his purple cloak 
Aside, and hastened toward the fleet. I took 
Gladly the garment he had left, and lay 
Till Morning in her golden chariot came. 
And now I would that I were young again, 629 

And in the vigor of my prime, for then 
Some one among the swineherds in the stalls 
Would find, I think, a cloak for me, through love 
And reverence of such a man ; but now 
They hold me in slight favor, dressed in rags.'* 62s 

And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply : 
" O aged man ! we see no cause of blame 
In thy recital, and of all thy words 
Not one is unbecoming or inapt. 
Thou shalt not lack for garments, nor aught else **> 
That any suppliant in his poverty 
Might hope for at our hands to-night. With morn 
Gird thou thy tatters on again ; for here 
We have not many cloaks, nor many a change 
Of raiment, — only one for each of us. 635 

But when the son of our Ulysses comes 
Again, he will provide thee with a cloak 
And tunic, and will send thee where thou wilt." 



Book XV. 43 

He spake and rose, and made his guest a bed 
Close to the hearth, and threw on it the skins 640 
Of sheep and goats, and there Ulysses lay, 
O'er whom the swineherd spread a thick large cloak, 
Which he had often worn for a defence 
When a wild winter storm was in the air. 

Thus slept Ulysses with the young men near. 645 
A couch within, and distant from his charge, 
Pleased not the swineherd, who first armed himself, 
And then went forth. Ulysses gladly saw 
That while he was in distant lands his goods 
Were watched so faithfully. Eumaeus hung 6 S o 

About his sturdy shoulders a sharp sword, 
And wrapped a thick cloak round him, tempest-proof, 
And took the hide of a huge pampered goat, 
And a well-pointed javelin for defence 
Both against dogs and men. So went he forth 6 S3 
To take his rest where lay the white-toothed swine, 
Herded and slumbering underneath a rock, 
Whose hollow fenced themfrom the keen north-wind.
