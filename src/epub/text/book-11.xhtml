" \T OW, when we reached our galley by the shore, 

1 ^1 We drew it first into the mighty deep, 
And set the mast and sails, and led on board 
The sheep, and sorrowfully and in tears 
Embarked ourselves. The fair-haired and august 5 
Circe, expert in music, sent with us 
A kindly fellow-voyager, — a wind 
That breathed behind the dark-prowed bark, and 

swelled 
The sails ; and now, with all things in their place 
Throughout the ship, we sat us down, — the breeze » 
And helmsman guiding us upon our way. 
All day our sails were stretched, as o'er the deep 
Our vessel ran ; the sun went down ; the paths 
Of the great sea were darkened, and our bark 
Reached the far confines of Oceanus. *s 






Book XL 225 

" There lies the land, and there the people dwell 
Of the Cimmerians, in eternal cloud " 
And darkness. Never does the glorious sun 
Look on them with his rays, when he goes up 
Into the starry sky, nor when again 20 

He sinks from heaven to earth. Unwholesome night 
O'erhangs the wretched race. We touched the land, 
And, drawing up our galley on the beach, 
Took from on board the sheep, and followed on 
Beside the ocean-stream until we reached 25 

The place of which the goddess Circe spake. 

" Here Perimedes and Eurylochus 
Held in their„grasp the victims, while I drew 
The trusty sword upon my thigh, and scooped 
A trench in earth, a cubit long and wide, 30 

Round which we stood, and poured to all the dead 
Libations, — - milk and honey first, and next 
Rich wine, and lastly water, scattering 
White meal upon them. Then I offered prayer 
Fervently to that troop of airy forms, 35 

And made a vow that I would sacrifice, 
When I at last should come to Ithaca, 
A heifer without blemish, barren yet, 
In my own courts, and heap the altar-pyre 
With things of price, and to the seer alone, 40 

Tiresias, by himself, a ram whose fleece 
Was wholly black, the best of all my flocks. 

" When I had worshipped thus with praver and 
vows 

10* 



226 The Odyssey. 

The nations of the dead, I took the sheep 

And pierced their throats above the hollow trench. *s 

The blood flowed dark ; and thronging round me 

came 
Souls of the dead from Erebus, — young wives 
And maids unwedded, men worn out with years 
And toil, and virgins of a tender age 
In their new grief, and many a warrior slain so 

In battle, mangled by the spear, and clad 
In bloody armor, who about the trench 
Flitted on every side, now here, now there, 
With gibbering cries, and I grew pale with fear. 
Then calling to my friends, I bade them flay 55 

The victims lying slaughtered by the knife, 
And, burning them with fire, invoke the gods, — 
The mighty Pluto and dread Proserpine. 
Then from my thigh I drew the trusty sword, 
And sat me down, and suffered none of all 60 

Those airy phantoms to approach the blood 
Until I should bespeak the Theban seer. 

" And first the soul of my companion came, 
Elpenor, for he was not buried yet 
In earth's broad bosom. We had left him dead 65 
In Circe's halls, unwept and unentombed. 
We had another task. But when I now 
Beheld I pitied him, and, shedding tears, 
I said these winged words : ' How earnest thou, 
Elpenor, hither into these abodes 70 

Of night and darkness ? Thou hast made more 

speed, 



Book XT, 227 

Although on foot, than I in my good ship.* 
" I spake ; the phantom sobbed and answered 
me : — 
1 Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise, 
Ulysses ! 't was the evil doom decreed 75 

By some divinity, and too much wine, 
That wrought my death. I laid myself to sleep 
In Circe's palace, and, remembering not 
The way to the long stairs that led below, 
Fell from the roof, and by the fall my neck «*• 

Was broken at the spine ; my soul went down 
To Hades. I conjure thee now, by those 
Whom thou hast left behind and far away, 
Thy consort and thy father, — him by whom 
Thou when a boy wert reared, — and by thy son U 
Telemachus, who in thy palace-halls 
Is left alone, — for well I know that thou, 
In going hence from Pluto's realm, wilt moor 
Thy gallant vessel in the ^Eaean isle, — 
That there, O king, thou wilt remember me, 90 

And leave me not when thou departest thence 
Unwept, unburied, lest I bring on thee 
The anger of the gods. But burn me there 
With all the armor that I wore, and pile, 
Close to the hoary deep, a mound for me, — 95 
A hapless man of whom posterity 
Shall hear. Do this for me, and plant upright 
Upon my tomb the oar with which I rowed, 
While yet a living man, among thy friends.' 



228 The Odyssey. 

" He spake and I replied : ' Unhappy youth, io» 
All this I duly will perform for thee.' 

" And then the soul of Anticleia came, — 
My own dead mother, daughter of the king 
Autolycus, large-minded. Her I left 
Alive, what time I sailed for Troy, and now 105 

I wept to see her there, and pitied her, 
And yet forbade her, though with grief, to come 
Near to the blood till I should first accost 
Tiresias. He too came, the Theban seer, 
Tiresias, bearing in his hand a wand no 

Of gold ; he knew me and bespake me thus : — 

" ' Why, O unhappy mortal, hast thou left 
The light of day to come among the dead 
And to this joyless land ? Go from the trench 
And turn thy sword away, that I may drink us 

The blood, and speak the word of prophecy.' 

" He spake ; withdrawing from the trench, I thrust 
Into its sheath my silver-studded sword, 
And after drinking of the dark red blood 
The blameless prophet turned to me and said : — xao 

" ' Illustrious chief Ulysses, thy desire 
Is for a happy passage to thy home, 
Yet will a god withstand thee. Not unmarked 
By Neptune shalt thou, as I deem, proceed 
Upon thy voyage. He hath laid up wrath x*. 

Against thee in his heart, for that thy hand 
Deprived his son of sight. Yet may ye still 
Return, though after many hardships borne, 



Book XL 229 

If thou but hold thy appetite in check, 

And that of thy companions, when thou bring 130 

Thy gallant bark to the Trinacrian isle, 

Safe from the gloomy deep. There will ye find 

The beeves and fading wethers of the Sun, — 

The all-beholding and all-hearing Sun. 

If these ye leave unharmed, and keep in mind 13s 

The thought of your return, ye may go back, 

Though sufferers, to your home in Ithaca ; 

But if thou do them harm, the event will be 

Destruction to thy ship and to its crew ; 

And thou, if thou escape it, wilt return 140 

Late to thy country, all thy comrades lost, 

And in a foreign bark, and thou shalt find 

Wrong in thy household, — arrogant men who waste 

Thy substance, wooers of thy noble wife, 

And offering bridal gifts. On thy return us 

Thou shalt avenge thee of their violent deeds ; 

And when thou shalt have slain them in thy halls, 

Whether by stratagem or by the sword 

In open fight, then take a shapely oar 

And journey on, until thou meet with men 150 

Who have not known the sea nor eaten food 

Seasoned with salt, nor ever have beheld 

Galleys with crimson prows, nor shapely oars, 

Which are the wings of ships. I will declare 

A sign by which to know them, nor canst thou 155 

Mistake it. When a traveller, meeting thee, 

Shalt say that thou dost bear a winnowing-fan 



230 The Odyssey. 

Upon thy sturdy shoulder, stop and plant 

Thy shapely oar upright in earth, and there 

Pay to King Neptune solemn sacrifice, — t6o 

A ram, a bull, and from his herd of swine 

A boar. And then returning to thy home, 

See that thou offer hallowed hecatombs 

To all the ever-living ones who dwell 

In the broad heaven, to each in order due. ,6 s 

So at the last thy death shall come to thee 

Far from the sea, and gently take thee off 

In a serene old age that ends among 

A happy people. I have told thee true.' 

" He spake, and thus I answered him : ' The 
gods, vf 

Tiresias, have decreed as thou hast said. 
But tell, and tell me truly, — I behold 
The soul of my dead mother ; there she sits 
In silence by the blood, and will not deign 
To look upon her son nor speak to him. 17s 

Instruct me, mighty prophet, by what means 
To make my mother know me for her son.' 

" I spake, and instantly the seer replied : — 
* Easily that is told ; I give it thee 
To bear in mind. Whoever of the dead *»> 

Thou sufferest to approach and drink the blood 
Will speak the truth ; those whom thou dost forbid 
To taste the blood will silently withdraw/ 

" The soul of King Tiresias, saying this, 
Passed to the abode of Pluto ; he had given *% 



Book XL 231 

The oracle I asked. I waited still 

Until my mother, drawing near again, 

Drank the dark blood ; she knew me suddenly, 

And said in piteous tones these winged words : — 

" ' How didst thou come, my child, a living man, 
Into this place of darkness ? Difficult ** 

It is for those who breathe the breath of life 
To visit these abodes, through which are rolled 
Great rivers, fearful floods, — the first of these 
Oceanus, whose waters none can cross *& 

Gn foot, or save on board a trusty bark. 
Hast thou come hither on thy way from Troy, 
A weary wanderer with thy ship and friends ? 
And hast thou not been yet at Ithaca, 
Nor in thine island palace seen thy wife ? ' 200 

" She spake, I answered : ' 'T is necessity, 
Dear mother, that has brought me to the abode 
Of Pluto, to consult the Theban seer, 
Tiresias. Not to the Achaian coast 
Have I returned, nor reached our country, yet 205 
Continually I wander ; everywhere 
I meet misfortune, — even from the time 
When, in the*noble Agamemnon's train, 
I came to Ilium, famed for steeds, and made 
War on its dwellers. Tell me now, I pray, m 

And truly, how it was that fate on thee 
Brought >the long sleep of death ? by slow disease ? 
Or, stealing on thee, did the archer-queen, 
Diana, slay thee with her silent shafts? 



232 The Odyssey. 

And tell me of my father, and the son *i 5 

Left in my palace. Rests the sway I bore 

On them, or has another taken it, 

Since men believe I shall return no more ? 

And tell me of my wedded wife, her thoughts 

And purposes, and whether she remains 2*> 

Yet with my son. Is she the guardian still 

Of my estates, or has the noblest chief 

Of those Achaians led her thence a bride ? ' 

" I spake ; my reverend mother answered thus : — 
* Most certain is it that she sadly dwells 22s 

Still in thy palace. Weary days and nights 
And tears are hers. No man has taken yet 
Thy place as ruler, but Telemachus 
Still has the charge of thy domain, and gives 
The liberal feasts which it befits a prince 230 

To give, for all invite him. In the fields 
Thy father dwells, and never in the town 
Is seen ; nor beds nor cloaks has he, nor mats 
Of rich device, but, all the winter through, 
He sleeps where sleep the laborers, on the hearth, 235 
Amid the dust, and wears a wretched garb ■ 
And when the summer comes, or autumn days 
Ripen the fruit, his bed is on the ground, 
And made of leaves, that everywhere are shed 
In the rich vineyards. There he lies and grieves, ■» 
And, cherishing his sorrow, mourns thy fate, 
And keenly feels the miseries of age. 
And thus I underwent my fate and died ; 



Book XL 233 

For not the goddess of the unerring bow 

Stealing upon me smote me in thy halls *»s 

With silent arrows, nor did slow disease 

Come o'er me, such as, wasting cruelly 

The members, takes at last the life away ; 

But constant longing for thee, anxious thoughts 

Of thee, and memory of thy gentleness, 250 

Ulysses, made an end of my sweet life/ 

" She spake ; I longed to take into my arms 
The soul of my dead mother. Thrice I tried, 
Moved by a strong desire, and thrice the form 
Passed through them like a shadow or a dream. «*» 
And then did the great sorrow in my heart 
Grow sharper, and in winged words I said : — 

" ' Beloved mother, why wilt thou not keep 
Thy place, that I may clasp thee, so that here, 
In Pluto's realm and in each other's arms, *fc 

We each might in the other soothe the sense 
Of misery ? Hath mighty Proserpine 
Sent but an empty shade to meet me here, 
That I might only grieve and sigh the more V 

" I spake, and then my reverend mother said : ^ 
' Believe not that Jove's daughter Proserpine *& 
Deceives thee. 'T is the lot of all our race 
When they are dead. No more the sinews bind 
The bones and flesh, when once from the white 

bones 
The life departs. Then like a dream the soul ** 
Flies off, and flits about from place to place. 



234 The Odyssey. 

But haste thou to the light again, and mark 
What I have said, that thou in after days 
Mayst tell it to thy wife on thy return.' 

"Thus we conferred. Meantime the women 
came m 

Around me, moved by mighty Proserpine ; 
In throngs they gathered to the dark red blood. 
Then, as I pondered how to question each, 
This seemed the wisest, — from my sturdy thigh 
I plucked the trenchant sword, and suffered not ** 
All that were there to taste the blood at once ; 
So one by one they came, and each in turn 
Declared her lineage. Thus I questioned all. 

" Then saw I high-born Tyro first, who claimed 
To be the daughter of that blameless man ^ 

Salmoneus, and who called herself the wife 
Of Cretheus, son of ^Eolus. She loved 
Enipeus, hallowed river, fairest stream 
Of all that flow on earth, and often walked 
Beside its pleasant waters. He whose arms ** 
Surround the islands, Neptune, once put on 
The river's form, and at its gulfy mouth 
Met her ; the purple waters stood upright 
Around them like a wall, and formed an arch, 
And hid the god and woman. There he loosed 29s 
The virgin zone of Tyro, shedding sleep 
Upon her. Afterward he took her hand 
And said : ' Rejoice, O maiden, in our love, 
For with the year's return shalt thou bring forth 






Book XL 

235 

Illustrious sons ; the embraces of the gods 

Are not unfruitful. Rear them carefully. 3 °° 

And now return to thy abode, and watch 
Thy words, and keep thy secret. Thou must know 
That I am Neptune, he who shakes the earth.' 

" He spake, and plunged into the billowy deep. 
And she became a mother, and brought forth 306 
Pelias and Neleus, valiant ministers 
Of mighty Jupiter. On the broad lands 
Of Iaolchos Pelias dwelt, and reared 
Vast flocks of sheep, while Neleus made his home 
In Pylos midst the sands. The queenly dame, 311 
His mother, meanwhile brought forth other sons 
To Cretheus, — ^Eson first, and Pheres next, 
And Amythaon, great in horsemanship. 

" And after her I saw Antiope, 31? 

The daughter of Asopus, — her who made 
A boast that she had slumbered in the arms 
Of Jove. Two sons she bore, — Amphion one, 
The other Zethus, — and they founded Thebes 
With its seven gates, and girt it round with towers ; 
For, valiant as they were, they could not dwell 321 
Safely in that great town unfenced by towers. 

" And after her I saw Amphitryon's wife, 
Alcmena, her who brought forth Hercules, 
The dauntless hero of the lion-heart, — 3*5 

For she had given herself into the arms 
Of mighty Jupiter. I also saw 
Megara there, a daughter of the house 



236 The Odyssey. 

Of kughty Creion. Her Amphitryon's son, 
Lhamable in strength, had made his wife. 330 

*' The mother, too, of (Edipus I saw, 
Jeautiful Epicaste, who in life 
Had done unwittingly a heinous deed, — 
Had married her own son, who, having slain 
Her father first, espoused her ; but the gods 335 
Published abroad the rumor of the crime. 
He in the pleasant town of Thebes bore sway 
O'er the Cadmeians ; yet in misery 
He lived, for so the offended gods ordained. 
And she went down to Hades and the gates 340 
That stand forever barred \ for, wild with grief, 
She slung a cord upon a lofty beam 
And perished by it, leaving him to bear 
Woes without measure, such as on a son 
The furies of a mother might inflict. us 

" And there I saw the dame supremely fair, 
Chloris, whom Neleus with large marriage-gifts 
Wooed, and brought home a bride 3 the youngest 

she 
Among the daughters of Iasus' son, 
Amphion, ruler o'er Orchomenus, ss° 

The Minyeian town, and o'er the realm 
Of Pylos. Three illustrious sons she bore 
To Neleus, — Nestor, Chromius, and a chief 
Of lofty bearing, Periclymenus. 
She brought forth Pero also, marvellous 355 

In beauty, wooed by all the region round ; 



Book XL 237 

but Neleus would bestow the maid on none 

Save him who should drive off from Phylace 

The beeves, broad-fronted and with crooked horns, 

Of valiant Iphicles, — a difficult task. & 

One man alone, a blameless prophet, dared 

Attempt it ; but he found himself withstood 

By fate, and rigid fetters, and a force 

Of rustic herdsmen. Months and days went by, 

And the full year, led by the hours, came round. 361 

The valiant Iphicles, who from the seer 

Had heard the oracles explained, took off 

The shackles, and the will of Jove was done. 

" Then saw I Leda, wife of Tyndarus, 
Who bore to Tyndarus two noble sons, 37*. 

Castor the horseman, Pollux skilled to wield 
The cestus. Both of them have still a place 
Upon the fruitful earth ; for Jupiter 
Gave them such honor that they live by turns 
Each one a day, and then are with the dead m 

Each one by turns ; they rank among the gods. 

" The wife of Aloeus next appeared, 
Iphidameia, who, as she declared, 
Had won the love of Neptune. She brought forth 
Two short-lived sons, — one like a god in form, 3& 
Named Otus ; and the other, far renowned, 
Named Ephialtes. These the bounteous earth 
Nourished to be the tallest of mankind, 
A.nd goodliest, save Orion. When the twain 
Had seen but nine years of their life, they stood 38? 



238 The Odyssey. 

In breadth of frame nine cubits, and in height 
Nine fathoms. They against the living gods 
Threatened to wage, upon the Olympian height, 
Fierce and tumultuous battle, and to fling 
Ossa upon Olympus, and to pile 3* 

Pelion, with all its growth of leafy woods, 
On Ossa, that the heavens might thus be scaled. 
And they, if they had reached their prime of youth, 
Had made their menace good. The son of Jove 
And amber-haired Latona took their lives vx 

Ere yet beneath their temples sprang the down 
And covered with its sprouting tufts the chin. 

" Phaedra I saw, and Procris, and the child 
Of the wise Minos, Ariadne, famed 
For beauty, whom the hero Theseus once m 

From Crete to hallowed Athens' fertile coast 
Led, but possessed her not. Diana gave 
Ear to the tale which Bacchus brought to her, 
And in the isle of Dia slew the maid. 

" And Maera I beheld, and Clymene, 4°s 

And Eriphyle, hateful in her guilt, 
Who sold her husband for a price in gold. 
But vainly might I think to name them all, — 
The wives and daughters of heroic men 
Whom I beheld, — for first the ambrosial night 410 
Would wear away. And now for me the hour 
Of sleep is come, at my good ship among 
My friends, or haply here. Meantime the care 
For my return is with the gods and you." 



Book XL 239 

He spake, and all were silent : all within 415 

The shadows of those palace-halls were held 
Motionless by the charm of what he said. 
And thus the white-armed Queen Arete spake ; — 

" Phaeacians, how appears this man to you 
In form, in stature, and well-judging mind ? *» 

My guest he is, but each among you shares 
The honor of the occasion. Now, I pray, 
Dismiss him not in haste, nor sparingly 
Bestow your gifts on one in so much need ; 
For in your dwellings is much wealth, bestowed vs 
Upon you by the bounty of the gods." 

Then also Echeneiis, aged chief, 
The oldest man of the Phaeacians, spake : — 

" My friends, the word of our sagacious queen 
Errs not, nor is ill-timed, and yours it is 430 

To hearken and obey : but all depends 
Upon Alcinoiis, — both the word and deed." 

And then in turn Alcinoiis spake : " That word 
Shall be fulfilled, if I am ruler here 
O'er the Phaeacians, skilled in seamanship. 435 

But let the stranger, though he long for home, 
Bear to remain till morning, that his store 
Of gifts may be complete. To send him home 
Shall be the charge of all, but mostly mine, 
Since mine it is to hold the sovereign power.'' 440 

And then the wise Ulysses said : " O King 
Alcinoiis, eminent o'er all thy race ! 
Shouldst thou command me to remain with thee 



240 The Odyssey. 

Even for a twelvemonth, and at length provide 

For my return, and give me princely gifts, 445 

Even that would please me ; for with fuller hands. 

The happier were my lot on my return 

To my own land. I should be honored then, 

And meet a kinder welcome there from all 

Who see me in my Ithaca once more." 45c 

And then again in turn Alcinoiis spake : — 
" Ulysses, when we look on thee, we feel 
No fear that thou art false, or one of those, 
The many, whom the dark earth nourishes, 
Wandering at large, and forging lies, that we 455 
May not suspect them. Thou hast grace of speech 
And noble thoughts, and fitly hast thou told, 
Even as a minstrel might, the history 
Of all thy Argive brethren and thy own. 
Now say, and frankly, didst thou also see 40> 

Any of those heroic men who went 
With thee to Troy, and in that region met 
Their fate ? A night immeasurably long 
Is yet before us. Let us have thy tale 
Of wonders. I could listen till the break 465 

Of hallowed morning, if thou canst endure 
So long to speak of hardships thou hast borne." 

He spake, and wise Ulysses answered thus : — 
w O King Alcinoiis, eminent beyond 
All others of thy people. For discourse 470 

There is a time ; there is a time for sleep. 
If more thou yet wouldst hear, I will not spare 



Book XL 241 

To give the story of the greater woes 

Of my companions, who were afterward 

Cut off from life ; and though they had escaped *r. 

The cruel Trojan war, on their return 

They perished by a woman's fraud and guilt. 

" When chaste Proserpina had made the ghosts 
Of women scatter right and left, there came 
The soul of Agamemnon, Atreus' son. <8o 

He came attended by a throng of those 
Who in the palace of ^gisthus met 
A fate like his and died. When he had drunk 
The dark red blood, he knew me at a look, 
And wailed aloud, and, bursting into tears, 435 

Stretched out his hands to touch me ; but no power 
Was there of grasp or pressure, such as once 
Dwelt in those active limbs. I could not help 
But weep at sight of him, for from my heart 
I pitied him, and spake these winged words : — 49° 

" ' Most glorious son of Atreus, king of men ! 
How, Agamemnon, has the fate that brings 
To man the everlasting sleep of death 
O'ertaken thee ? Did Neptune, calling up 
The winds in all their fury, make thy fleet 49s 

A wreck, or did thine enemies on land 
Smite thee, as thou wert driving off their beeves 
And their fair flocks, or fighting to defend 
Some city, and the helpless women there?' 

" I spake, and Agamemnon thus replied : — *» 
'Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise, 

. VOL.1. 11 ' 



242 The Odyssey. 

T was not that Neptune calling up the winds 

In all their fury wrecked me in my fleet, 

Nor hostile warriors smote me on the land, 

But that yEgisthus, bent upon my death, 50$ 

Plotted against me with my guilty wife, 

And bade me to his house and slew me there, 

Even at the banquet, as a hind might slay 

A bullock at the stall. With me they slew 

My comrades, as a herd of white-toothed swine s» 

Are slaughtered for some man of large estates, 

Who makes a wedding or a solemn feast. 

Thou hast seen many perish by the sword 

In the hard battle, one by one, and yet 

Thou wouldst have pitied us, hadst thou beheld s*s 

The slain beside the wine-jar, and beneath 

The loaded tables, while the pavement swam 

With blood. I heard Cassandra's piteous cry, 

The cry of Priam's daughter, stricken down 

By treacherous Clytemnestra at my side. 520 

And there I lay, and, dying, raised my hands 

To grasp my sword. The shameless woman went 

Her way, nor stayed to close my eyes, nor press 

My mouth into its place, although my soul 

Was on its way to Hades. There is naught 525 

That lives more horrible, more lost to shame, 

Than is the woman who has brought her mind 

To compass deeds like these, — the wretch who plans 

So foul a crime, — the murder of the man 

Whom she a virgin wedded. I had looked &* 



Book XL 243 

For a warm welcome from my children here, 
And all my household in my ancient home. 
This woman, deep in wickedness, hath brought 
Disgrace upon herself and all her sex, 
Even those who give their thoughts to doing good.' 535 

"He spake, and I replied : ' O, how the God 
Who wields the thunder, Jupiter, must hate 
The house of Atreus for the women's sake ! 
At first we fell by myriads in the cause 
Of Helen ; Clytemnestra now hath planned 540 

This guile against thee while thou wert afar.' 

" I spake, and instantly his answer came : — 
* Therefore be not compliant to thy wife, 
Nor let her hear from thee whatever lies 
Within thy knowledge. Tell her but a part, 54s 

And keep the rest concealed. Yet is thy life, 
Ulysses, in no danger from thy spouse : 
For wise and well instructed in the rules 
Of virtuous conduct is Penelope, 
The daughter of Icarius. When we went sso 

To war, we left her a young bride ; a babe 
Was at her breast, a boy, who now must sit 
Among grown men ; and fortunate is he, 
For certainly his father will behold 
The youth on his return, and he embrace 555 

His father, as is meet. But as for me, 
My consort suffered not my eyes to feed 
Upon the sight of my own son ; for first 
She slew me. This, then, I admonish thee, — 



244 The Odyssey. 

Heed thou my words. Bring not thy ship to land s<* 

Openly in thy country, but by stealth, 

Since now no longer can we put our trust 

In woman. Meantime, tell me of my son, 

And faithfully, if thou hast heard of him 

As living, whether in Orchomenus, s«s 

Or sandy Pylos, or in the broad realm 

Of Menelaus, Sparta ; for not yet 

Has my Orestes passed from earth and life.' 

" He spake, and I replied : ' Why ask of me 
That question, O Atrides ? I know not 570 

Whether thy son be living or be dead, 
And this is not a time for idle words.' 

" Thus in sad talk we stood, and freely flowed 
Our tears. Meanwhile the ghosts of Peleus' son 
Achilles, and Patroclus, excellent 57- 

Antilochus, and Ajax, all drew near, — 
Ajax for form and stature eminent 
O'er all the Greeks save Peleus' faultless son. 
Then did the soul of fleet ^Eacides 
Know me, and thus in winged words he said : — 580 

" ' Ulysses ! what hath moved thee to attempt 
This greatest of thy labors ? How is it 
That thou hast found the courage to descend 
To Hades, where the dead, the bodiless forms 
Of those whose work is done on earth, abide ? ' 585 

" He spake ; I answered : ' Greatest of the 
Greeks ! 
A.chilles, son of Peleus ! 'T was to hear 



Book XL 245 

The counsel of Tiresias that I came, 

If haply he might tell me by what means 

To reach my rugged Ithaca again ; 390 

For yet have I not trod my native coast, 

Nor even have drawn nigh to Greece. I meet 

Misfortunes everywhere. But as for thee, 

Achilles, no man lived before thy time, 

Nor will hereafter live, more fortunate a* 

Than thou, — for while alive we honored thee 

As if thou wert a god, and now again 

In these abodes thou rulest o'er the dead ; 

Therefore, Achilles, shouldst thou not be sad.' 

"I spake ; Achilles quickly answered me : — &» 
* Noble Ulysses, speak not thus of death, 
As if thou couldst console me. I would be 
A laborer on earth, and serve for hire 
Some man of mean estate, who makes scant cheer, 
Rather than reign o'er all who have gone down fcs 
To death. Speak rather of my noble son, 
Whether or not he yet has joined the wars 
To fight among the foremost of the host 
And tell me also if thou aught hast heard 
Of blameless Peleus, — whether he be yet 610 

Honored among his many Myrmidons, 
Or do they hold him now in small esteem 
In Hellas and in Phthia, since old age 
Unnerves his hands and feet, and I no more 
Am there, beneath the sun, to give him aid, 615 
Strong as I was on the wide plain of Troy, 



246 The Odyssey. 

When warring for the Achaian cause I smote 

That valiant people. Could I come again, 

But for a moment, with my former strength, 

Into my father's palace, I would make &» 

That strength and these unconquerable hands 

A terror to the men who do him wrong, 

And rob him of the honor due a king.' 

" He spake ; I answered : ' Nothing have I heard 
Of blameless Peleus, but I will relate 625 

The truth concerning Neoptolemus, 
Thy son, as thou requirest. Him I took 
From Scyros in a gallant bark to join 
The well-armed Greeks. Know, then, that when 

we sat 
In council, planning to conduct the war 630 

Against the city of Troy, he always rose 
The first to speak, nor were his words unwise. 
The godlike Nestor and myself alone 
Rivalled him in debate. And when we fought 
About the city walls, he loitered not 6 3S 

Among the others in the numerous host, 
But hastened on before them, giving place 
To no man there in valor. Many men 
He slew in desperate combat, whom to name 
Were past my power, so many were they all *>& 

Whom in the cause of Greece he struck to earth. 
Yet one I name, Eurypylus, the son 
Of Telephus, who perished by his sword 
With many of his band, Citeians, led 



Book XL 247 

To war because of liberal gifts bestowed &as 

Upon their chieftain's wife ; the noblest he 

Of men, in form, whom I have ever seen, 

Save Memnon. When into the wooden steed, 

Framed by Epeius, we the chiefs of Greece 

Ascended, and to me was given the charge e 5 o 

Of all things there, to open and to shut 

The close-built fraud, while others of high rank 

Among the Greeks were wiping off their tears, 

And their limbs shook, I never saw thy son 

Turn pale in his fine face, or brush away *& 

A tear, but he besought me earnestly 

That he might leave our hiding-place, and grasped 

His falchion's hilt, and lifted up his spear 

Heavy with brass, for in his mind he smote 

The Trojan crowd already. When at last <** 

We had o'erthrown and sacked the lofty town 

Of Priam, he embarked upon a ship, 

With all his share of spoil, — a large reward, — 

Unhurt, not touched in combat hand to hand, 

Nor wounded from afar, as oftentimes <*s 

Must be the fortune of a fight, for Mars 

Is wont to rage without regard to men.' 

" I spake. The soul of swift ^Eacides 
Over the meadows thick with asphodel 
Departed with long strides, well pleased to hear 670 
From me the story of his son's renown. 

"The other ghosts of those who lay in death 
Stood sorrowing by, and each one told his griefs ; 



248 The Odyssey. 

But that of Ajax, son of Telamon, 

Kept far aloof, displeased that I had won 675 

The victory contending at the fleet 

Which should possess the arms of Peleus' son. 

His goddess-mother laid them as a prize 

Before us, and the captive sons of Troy 

And Pallas were the umpires to award 680 

The victory. And now how much I wish 

I had not conquered in a strife like that, 

Since for that cause the dark earth hath received 

The hero Ajax, who in nobleness 

Of form and greatness of exploits excelled 68 5 

All other Greeks, except the blameless son 

Of Peleus. Then I spake in soothing words : — 

" ' O Ajax, son of blameless Telamon ! 
Wilt thou not even in death forget the wrath 
Caused by the strife for those accursed arms ? &* 
The gods have made them fatal to the Greeks, 
For thou, the bulwark of our host, didst fall, 
And we lamented thee as bitterly 
When thou wert dead as we had mourned the son 
Of Peleus. Nor was any man to blame ; 695 

'T was Jupiter who held in vehement hate 
The army of the warlike Greeks, and laid 
This doom upon thee. Now, O king, draw near, 
And hear our voice and words, and check, I pray, 
The anger rising in thy generous breast/ 700 

" I spake ; he answered not, but moved away 
To Erebus, among the other souls 



Book XL. 249 

Of the departed. Yet would I have had 
Speech of him, angry as he was, or else 
Have spoken to him further, but my wish 70s 

Was strong to see yet others of the dead. 

" Then I beheld the illustrious son of Jove, 
Minos, a golden sceptre in his hand, 
Sitting to judge the dead, who round the king 
Pleaded their causes. There they stood or sat 7*0 
In Pluto's halls, — a pile with ample gates. 

" And next I saw the huge Orion drive, 
Across the meadows green with asphodel, 
The savage beast whom he had slain ; he bore 
The brazen mace, which no man's power could 
break. 71s 

" And Tityus there I saw, — the mighty earth 
His mother, — overspreading, as he lay, 
Nine acres, with two vultures at his side, 
That, plucking at his liver, plunged their beaks 
Into the flesh ; nor did his hands avail 720 

To drive them off, for he had offered force 
To Jove's proud wife Latona, as she went 
To Pytho, through the pleasant Panopeus. 

" And next I looked on Tantalus, a prey 
To grievous torments, standing in a lake 7=s 

That reached his chin. Though painfully athirst, 
He could not drink ; as often as he bowed 
His aged head to take into his lips 
The water, it was drawn away, and sank 
Into the earth, and the dark soil appeared 73° 

11* 



250 The Odyssey. 

Around his feet ; a god had dried it up. 

And lofty trees drooped o'er him, hung with fruit, — 

Pears and pomegranates, apples fair to sight, 

And luscious figs, and olives green of hue. 

And when that ancient man put forth his hands 73s 

To pluck them from their stems, the wind arose 

And whirled them far among the shadowy clouds. 

" There I beheld the shade of Sisyphus 
Amid his sufferings. With both hands he rolled 
A huge stone up a hill. To force it up, 740 

He leaned against the mass with hands and feet ; 
But, ere it crossed the summit of the hill 
A power was felt that sent it rolling back, 
And downward plunged the unmanageable rock 
Before him to the plain. Again he toiled 74s 

To heave it upward, while the sweat in streams 
Ran down his limbs, and dust begrimed his brow. 

" Then I beheld the mighty Hercules, — 
The hero's image, — for he sits himself 
Among the deathless gods, well pleased to share 750 
Their feasts, and Hebe of the dainty feet — 
A daughter of the mighty Jupiter 
And golden-sandalled Juno — is his wife. 
Around his image flitted to and fro 
The ghosts with noise, like fear-bewildered birds. 75s 
His look was dark as night. He held in hand 
A naked bow, a shaft upon the string, 
And fiercely gazed, like one about to send 
The arrow forth. Upon his breast he wore 



Book XL 251 

The formidable baldric, on whose band ■& 

Of gold were sculptured marvels, — forms of b^ars, 
Wild boars, grim lions, battles, skirmishings, 
And death by wounds, and slaughter. He who 

wrought 
That band had never done the like before, 
Nor could thereafter. As I met his eye, :§s 

The hero knew me, and, beholding me 
With pity, said to me in winged words : — 

" ' Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise, 
And yet unhappy ; surely thou dost bear 
A cruel fate, like that which I endured 77c 

While yet I saw the brightness of the sun. 
The offspring of Saturnian Jupiter 
Am I, and yet was I compelled to serve 
One of a meaner race than I, who set 
Difficult tasks. He sent me hither once ns 

To bring away the guardian hound ; he deemea 
No harder task might be. I brought him hence 9 
I led him up from Hades, with such aid 
As Hermes and the blue-eyed Pallas gave.' 

" Thus having spoken, he withdrew again 580 

Into the abode of Pluto. I remained 
And kept my place, in hope there yet might come 
Heroes who perished in the early time, 
And haply I might look on some of those, — 
The ancients, whom I greatly longed to see, — 78s 
On Theseus and Pirithous, glorious men, 
The children of the gods. But now there flocked 



252 The Odyssey. 

Already round me, with a mighty noise, 

The innumerable nations of the dead ; 

And I grew pale with fear, lest from the halls 79* 

Of Pluto the stern Proserpine should send 

The frightful visage of the monster-maid, 

The Gorgon. Hastening to my ship, I bade 

The crew embark, and cast the hawsers loose. 

Quickly they went on board, and took their seats 79s 

Upon the benches. Through Oceanus 

The current bore my galley, aided first 

By oars and then by favorable gales."
