u \ T 7E reached the ^Eolian isle, where ^olus> 

V V Dear to the gods, a son of Hippotas, 
Made his abode. It was a floating isle ; 



200 The Odyssey. 

A wall of brass enclosed it, and smooth rocks 

Edged it around. Twelve children in his halls s 

Were born, six daughters and six blooming sons ; 

He gave his daughters to his sons for wives. 

And they with their dear father and his queen 

Banquet from day to day, with endless change 

Of meats before them. In his halls all day » 

The sound of pipes is in the perfumed air; 

At night the youths beside their modest wives 

Sleep on fair couches spread with tapestry. 

So coming to his town and fair abode, 

I found a friendly welcome. One full month 15 

The monarch kept me with him, and inquired 

Of all that might concern the fate of Troy, 

The Argive fleet, and the return to Greece, 

And just as it befell I told him all. 

And when I spake to him of going thence, *> 

And prayed him to dismiss me, he complied, 

And helped to make us ready for the sea. 

The bladder of a bullock nine years old 

He gave, in which he had compressed and bound 

The stormy winds of air ; for Saturn's son 25 

Had given him empire o'er the winds, with power 

To calm them or to rouse them at his will. 

This in our roomy galley he made fast 

With a bright chain of silver, that no breath 

Of ruder air might blow. He only left s° 

The west wind free to waft our ships and us 

Upon our way. But that was not to be ; 



Book X. 201 

We perished by a folly of our own. 

" Nine days we held our way, both day and night ; 
And now appeared in sight our native fields 35 

On the tenth night, where on the shore we saw 
Men kindling fires. Meantime a pleasant sleep 
Had overcome my weary limbs, for long 
Had I been guiding with incessant toil 
The rudder, nor would trust it to the hand 40 

Of any other, such was my desire 
To reach our country by the shortest way. 
Then talked my crew among themselves, and said 
That I had brought with me from y'Eolus, 
The large-souled son of Hippotas, rich gifts 45 

Of gold and silver. Standing side by side 
And looking at each other, thus they said : — 

" ' How wonderfully is our chief revered 
And loved by all men, wander where he will 
Into what realm soever ! From the coast 30 

Of Troy he sailed with many precious things, 
His share of spoil, while we, who with him went 
And with him came, are empty-handed yet ; 
And now hath ^Eolus, to show how much 
He prizes him, bestowed the treasures here. 55 

Come, let us see them ; let us know how much 
Of gold and silver is concealed in this.' 

" Thus speaking to each other, they obeyed 
The evil counsel. They untied the sack, 
And straight the winds rushed forth and seized the 
ship, 



202 The Odyssey. 

And swept the crews, lamenting bitterly, 

Far from their country out upon the deep ; 

And then I woke, and in my noble mind 

Bethought me whether I should drop at once 

Into the deep and perish, or remain  

And silently endure and keep my place 

Among the living. I remained, endured, 

And covered with my mantle lay within 

My galley, while the furious whirlwind bore 

Back to the ^Eolian isle our groaning crews. 70 

u We landed on the coast, and to our barks 
Brought water. Then my men prepared a meal 
Beside the fleet ; and having tasted food 
And wine, I took a herald and a friend, 
And, hastening to the sumptuous palace-halls 75 
Of ^olus, I found him with his wife 
And children banqueting. We sat us down 
Upon the threshold at the palace-doors, 
And they were all astonished, and inquired : — 

" ' Why art thou here ? What god thine enemy so 
Pursues thee, O Ulysses ! whom we sent 
So well prepared to reach thy native land, 
Thy home, or any place that pleased thee most ? ' 

"They spake, and sorrowfully I replied : — 
4 The fault is all with my unthinking crew «s 

And my own luckless slumber. Yet, my friends, 
Repair the mischief, for ye have the power.' 

" Thus with submissive words I spake, but they 
Sat mute, the father only answered me : — 



Book X. 203 

" * Hence with thee ! Leave our island instantly, 91 
Vilest of living men ! It may not be 
That I receive or aid as he departs 
One who is hated by the blessed gods, — 
And thou art hated by the gods. Away ! ' 

" He spake, and sent us from the palace-door # 
Lamenting. Sorrowfully went we on. 
And now with rowing hard and long, — the fruit 
Of our own folly, — all our crews lost heart, 
And every hope of safe return was gone. 

" Six days and nights we sailed ; the seventh we 
came 100 

*f o lofty Laestrigoni with wide gates, 
The city of Lamos, where, on going forth, 
The shepherd calls to shepherd entering in. 
There might a man who never yields to sleep 
Earn double wages, first in pasturing herds, *>s 

And then in tending sheep ; for there the fields 
Grazed in the daytime are by others grazed 
At night. We reached its noble haven, girt 
By towering rocks that rise on every side, 
And the bold shores run out to form its mouth, — »« 
A narrow entrance. There the other crews 
Stationed their barks, and moored them close beside 
Each other, in that hill-encircled port. 
No billow, even the smallest, rises there ; 
The water glimmers with perpetual calm. us 

1 only kept my dark-hulled ship without, 
And bound its cable to a jutting rock. 



204 The Odyssey. 

" I climbed a rugged headland, and looked forth. 
No marks of tilth appeared, the work of men 
Or oxen, only smokes that from below m 

Rose in the air. And then I sent forth scouts 
To learn what race of men who live by bread 
Inhabited the land. Two chosen men 
I sent, a herald made the third ; and these 
Went inland by a level path, on which 125 

The wains brought fuel from the woody heights 
Into the city. On their way they met, 
Before the town, a damsel with an ewer, — 
The stately daughter of Antiphates, 
The Laestrigonian, who was coming down no 

To where Artacia's smoothly flowing fount 
Gave water for the city. They drew near 
And spake, and asked her who was sovereign there, 
And who his people. Straight she pointed out 
A lofty pile in which her father dwelt. 13s 

They entered that proud palace, and beheld, 
Tall as a mountain peak, the monarch's wife, 
And shuddered at the sight. With eager haste 
She called her husband, King Antiphates, 
From council. With a murderous intent i-p 

He came, and, seizing one of my poor friends, 
Devoured him, while the other two betook 
Themselves to sudden flight and reached the ships. 
And then he raised a fearful yell that rang 
Through all the city. The strong Lsestrigons 'is 
Rushed forth by thousands from all sides, more like 



Book X. 205 

To giants than to common men. They hurled 
Stones of enormous weight from cliffs above, 
And cries of those who perished and the crash 
Of shattered galleys rose. They speared our 
friends is« 

Like fishes for their horrid feasts, and thus 
Bore them away. While those within the port 
Were slaughtered, drawing my good sword I cut 
The hawsers fastened to my ship's blue prow, 
And cheered my men, and bade them fling them- 
selves 15s 
Upon the oars, that so we might escape 
Our threatened fate. They heard, and plied their oars 
Like men who rowed for life. The galley shot 
Forth from these beetling rocks into the sea 
Full gladly ; all the others perished there. i&j 

" Onward we sailed, with sorrow in our hearts 
For our lost friends, though glad to be reprieved 
From death. And now we landed at an isle, — 
/Eaja, where the fair-haired Circe dwelt, 
A goddess high in rank and skilled in song, *&■ 

Own sister of the wise ^Esetes. Both 
Were children of the source of light, the Sun, 
And Perse, Ocean's daughter, brought them forth. 
We found a haven here, where ships might lie ; 
And guided by some deity we brought w 

Our galley silently against the shore, 
And disembarked, and gave two days and nights 
To rest, unmanned with hardship and with grief. 



206 The Odyssey. 

" When bright-haired Morning brought the third 
day round, 
I took my spear and my good sword, and left 175 
The ship, and climbed a height, in hope to spy 
Some trace of human toil, or hear some voice. 
On a steep precipice I stood, and saw 
From the broad earth below a rising smoke, 
Where midst the thickets and the forest-ground is» 
Stood Circe's palace. Seeing that dark smoke, 
The thought arose within my mind that there 
I should inquire. I pondered till at last 
This seemed the wisest, — to return at once 
To my good ship upon the ocean-side, .35 

And give my crew their meal, and send them forth 
To view the region. Coming to the spot 
Where lay my well-oared bark, some pitying god 
Beneath whose eye I wandered forth alone 
Sent a huge stag into my very path, '

High-horned, which from his pasture in the wood 
Descended to the river-side to drink, 
For grievously he felt the hot sun's power. 
Him as he ran I smote ; the weapon pierced, 
Just at the spine, the middle of his back. 395 

The brazen blade passed through, and with a moon 
He fell amid the dust, and yielded up 
His life. I went to him, and set my foot 
Against him, and plucked forth the brazen spear, 
And left it leaning there. And then I broke ;«■ 
Lithe osiers from the shrubs, and twined of these 



Book X. 207 

A rope, which, doubled, was an ell in length. 

With that I tied the enormous creature's feet, 

And slung him on my neck, and brought him thus 

To my black ship. I used the spear to prop *>s 

My steps, since he no longer could be borne 

Upon the shoulder, aided by the hand, 

Such was the animal's bulk. I flung him down 

Before the ship, encouraging my men 

With cheerful words, and thus I said to each : — ™ 

" l My friends, we will not, wretched as we are, 
Go down to Pluto's realm before our time. 
While food and wine are yet within the hold 
Of our good galley, let us not forget 
Our daily meals, and famine-stricken pine.' «s 

" I spake ; they all obeyed, and at my word 
Came forth, and standing by the barren deep 
Admired the stag, for he was huge of bulk ; 
And when their eyes were tired with wondering, 
My people washed their hands, and soon had made 2* 
A noble banquet ready. All that day 
Till set of sun we sat and feasted there 
Upon the abundant meat and delicate wine ; 
And when the sun went down, and darkness came, 
We slept upon the shore. But when the Morn, 22s 
The rosy-fingered child of Dawn, looked forth, 
I called a council of my men and spake : — 

" * Give ear, my friends, amid your sufferings, 
To words that I shall say. We cannot here 
Know which way lies the west, nor where the east, *x 



208 The Odyssey. 

Nor where the sun, that shines for all mankind, 
Descends below the earth, nor where again 
He rises from it. Yet will we consult, 
If room there be for counsel, — which I doubt, 
For when I climbed that height I overlooked =35 
An isle surrounded by the boundless deep, — 
An isle low lying. In the midst I saw 
Smoke rising from a thicket of the wood.' 

" I spake ; their courage died within their hearts 
As they remembered what Antiphates, iv> 

The Laestrigon, had done, and what foul deeds 
The cannibal Cyclops, and they wept aloud. 
Tears flowed abundantly, but tears were now 
Of no avail to our unhappy band. 

"Numbering my well-armed men, I made of 
them 345 

Two equal parties, giving each its chief. 
Myself commanded one ; Eurylochus, 
The hero, took the other in his charge. 

" Then in a brazen helm we shook the lots ; 
The lot of brave Eurylochus leaped forth, *

And he with two-and-twenty of our men 
Went forward with quick steps, and yet in tears, 
While we as sorrowful were left behind. 

" They found the fair abode where Circe dwelt, 
A palace of hewn stone within the vale, *ss 

Yet nobly seated. There were mountain wolves 
And lions round it, which herself had tamed 
With powerful drugs \ yet these assaulted not 



Book X. 209 

The visitors, but, wagging their long tails, 
Stood on their hinder feet, and fawned on them, *so 
Like mastiffs on their master when he comes 
From banqueting and brings them food. So fawned 
The strong-clawed wolves and lions on my men. 
With fear my men beheld those beasts of prey, 
Yet went, and, standing in the portico 265 

Of the bright-haired divinity, they heard 
Her sweet voice singing, as within she threw 
The shuttle through the wide immortal web, 
Such as is woven by the goddesses, — 
Delicate, bright of hue, and beautiful. 270 

" Polites then, a chief the most beloved 
And most discreet of all my comrades, spake : — 

" * Some one is here, my friends, who sweetly sings. 
Weaving an ample web, and all the floor 
Rings to her voice. Whoever she may be, 275 

Woman or goddess, let us call to her.' 

" He spake ; aloud they called, and forth she came 
And threw at once the shining doors apart, 
And bade my comrades enter. Without thought 
They followed her. Eurylochus alone a

Remained without, for he suspected guile. 
She led them in and seated them on thrones. 
Then mingling for them Pramnian wine with cheese, 
Meal, and fresh honey, and infusing drugs 
Into the mixture, — drugs which made them lose 283 
The memory of their home, — she handed them 
The beverage and they drank. Then instantly 



2IO The Odyssey. 

She touched them with a wand, and shut them up 
In sties, transformed to swine in head and voice, 
Bristles and shape, though still the human mind ** 
Remained to them. Thus sorrowing they were driven 
Into their cells, where Circe flung to them 
Acorns of oak and ilex, and the fruit 
Of cornel, such as nourish wallowing swine. 

" Back came Eurylochus to our good ship 295 

With news of our poor comrades and their fate, 
He strove to speak, but could not; he was stunned 
By that calamity ; his eyes were filled 
With tears, and his whole soul was given to grief. 
We marvelled greatly ; long we questioned him, 300 
And thus he spake of our lost friends at last : — 

" ■ Through yonder thickets, as thou gav'st com- 
mand, 
Illustrious chief! we went, until we reached 
A stately palace of hewn stones, within 
A vale, yet nobly seated. Some one there, 30s 

Goddess or woman, weaving busily 
An ample web, sang sweetly as she wrought. 
My comrades called aloud, and forth she came, 
And threw at once the shining doors apart, 
And bade us enter. Without thought the rest 310 
Followed, while I alone, suspecting guile, 
Remained without. My comrades, from that hour, 
Were seen no more ; not one of them again 
Came forth, though long I sat and watched for them." 

" He spake ; I slung my silver-studded sword 315 



Book X. 2 J i 

Upon my shoulders, — a huge blade of brass, — 

And my bow with it, and commanded him 

To lead the way. He seized and clasped my knees 

With both his hands in attitude of prayer, 

And sorrowfully said these winged words : — 3* 

" ' Take me not thither ; force me not to go, 
O foster-child of Jove ! but leave me here ; 
For thou wilt not return, I know, nor yet 
Deliver one of our lost friends. Our part 
Is to betake ourselves to instant flight 323 

With these who yet remain, and so escape.' 

" He spake, and I replied : ' Eurylochus, 
Remain thou here, beside our roomy ship, 
Eating and drinking. I shall surely go. 
A strong necessity is laid on me.' 330 

" I spake, and from the ship and shore went up 
Into the isle 5 and when I found myself 
Within that awful valley, and not far 
From the great palace in which Circe dwelt, 
The sorceress, there met me on my way 335 

A youth ; he seemed in manhood's earJy prime, 
When youth has most of grace. He took my hand 
And held it, and, accosting me, began : — 

" ' Rash mortal ! whither art thou wandering thus 
A.lone among the hills, where every place 340 

Is strange to thee? Thy comrades are shut up 
In Circe's palace in close cells like swine. 
Com'st thou to set them free ? Nay, thou like them 
Wilt rather find thyself constrained to stay. 



212 The Odyssey. 

Let me bestow the means to make thee safe ws 

Against that mischief. Take this potent herb, 

And bear it with thee to the palace-halls 

Of Circe, and it shall avert from thee 

The threatened evil. I will now reveal 

The treacherous arts of Circe. She will bring 350 

A mingled draught to thee, and drug the bowl, 

But will not harm thee thus ; the virtuous plant 

I gave thee will prevent it. Hear yet more : 

When she shall smite thee with her wand, draw forth 

Thy good sword from thy thigh and rush at her 355 

As if to take her life, and she will crouch 

In fear, and will solicit thine embrace. 

Refuse her not, that so she may release 

Thy comrades, and may send thee also back 

To thine own land ; but first exact of her 360 

The solemn oath which binds the blessed gods, 

That she will meditate no other harm 

To thee, nor strip thee of thy manly strength.' 

"The Argus-queller spake, and plucked from earth 
The potent plant and handed it to me, 365 

And taught me all its powers. The root is black, 
The blossom white as milk. Among the gods 
Its name is Moly ; hard it is for men 
To dig it up ; the gods find nothing hard. 

" Back through the woody island Hermes went 370 
Toward high Olympus, while I took my way 
To Circe's halls, yet with a beating heart. 
There, as I stood beneath the portico 



Book X. 213 

Of that bright-haired divinity, I called 

Aloud ; the goddess heard my voice and came, 37s 

And threw at once the shining doors apart, 

And prayed me to come in. I followed her, 

Yet grieving still. She led me in and gave 

A seat upon a silver-studded throne, 

Beautiful, nobly wrought, and placed beneath 3> 

A footstool, and prepared a mingled draught 

Within a golden chalice, and infused 

A drug with mischievous intent. She gave 

The cup ; I drank it off; the charm wrought not, 

And then she smote me with her wand and said : — 38s 

* Go to the sty, and with thy fellows sprawl.' 

" She spake ; but drawing forth the trusty sword 
Upon my thigh, I rushed at her as if 
To take her life. She shrieked and, stooping low, 
Ran underneath my arm and clasped my knees, 390 
And uttered piteously these winged words : — 

" ' Who art thou ? of what race and of what land, 
And who thy parents ? I am wonder-struck 
To see that thou couldst drink that magic juice 
And yield not to its power. No living man, 395 

Whoever he might be, that tasted once 
Those drugs, or passed them o'er his lips, has yet 
Withstood them. In thy breast a spirit dwells 
Not to be thus subdued. Art thou not then 
Ulysses, master of wise stratagems, 400 

Whose coming hither, on his way from Troy, 
In his black galley, oft has been foretold 



214 The Odyssey. 

By Hermes of the golden wand ? But sheathe 
Thy sword and share my couch, that, joined in love, 
Each may hereafter trust the other's faith.' 405 

" She spake, and I replied : ' How canst thou ask, 

Circe, that I gently deal with thee, 

Since thou, in thine own palace, hast transformed 

My friends to swine, and plottest even now 

To keep me with thee, luring me to pass 4*» 

Into thy chamber and to share thy couch, 

That thou mayst strip me of my manly strength 

1 come not to thy couch till thou engage, 
O goddess, by a solemn oath, that thou 

Wilt never seek to do me further harm.' 4rs 

" I spake ; she straightway took the oath required, 
And, after it was uttered and confirmed, 
Up to her sumptuous couch I went. Meanwhile 
Four diligent maidens ministered within 
The palace, — servants of the household they, 420 
Who had their birth from fountains and from groves, 
And sacred rivers flowing to the sea. 
One spread the thrones with gorgeous coverings ; 
Above was purple arras, and beneath 
Were linen webs ; another, setting forth 425 

The silver tables just before the thrones, 
Placed on them canisters of gold ; a third 
Mingled the rich wines in a silver bowl, 
And placed the golden cups ; and, last, the fourth 
Brought water from the fountain, and beneath a* 
A massive tripod kindled a great fire 



Book X. 215 

And warmed the water. When it boiled within 
The shining brass, she led me to the bath, 
And washed me from the tripod. On my head 
And shoulders pleasantly she shed the streams 435 
That from my members took away the sense 
Of weariness, unmanning body and mind. 
And when she thus had bathed me and with oil 
Anointed me, she put a princely cloak 
And tunic on me, led me in, and showed 4*» 

My seat, — a stately silver-studded throne, 
High-wrought, — and placed a footstool for my feet. 
Then came a handmaid with a golden ewer, 
And from it poured pure water for my hands 
Into a silver laver. Next she placed hs 

A polished table near to me, on which 
The matron of the palace laid the feast, 
With many delicacies from her store, 
And bade me eat. The banquet pleased me not. 
My thoughts were elsewhere ; dark imaginings 4s° 
Were in my mind. When Circe marked my mood. 
As in a gloomy revery I sat, 
And put not forth my hands to touch the feast, 
She came to me and spake these winged words : — 
" 'Why sittest thou like one who has no power 455 
Of speech, Ulysses, wrapt in thoughts that gnaw 
Thy heart, and tasting neither food nor wine ? 
Still dost thou dream of fraud ? It is not well 
That thou shouldst fear it longer, since I pledged 
Myself against it with a mighty oath.' 



2\6 The Odyssey. 

" She spake, and I replied : ' What man whose 
heart 
Is faithful could endure to taste of food 
Or wine till he should see his captive friends 
Once more at large ? If with a kind intent 
Thou bidst me eat and drink, let me behold 465 

With mine own eyes my dear companions free/ 

" I spake ; and Circe took her wand and went 
Forth from her halls, and, opening the gate 
That closed the sty, drove forth what seemed a herd 
Of swine in their ninth year. They ranged therm 
selves 470 

Before her, and she went from each to each 
And shed on them another drug. Forthwith 
Fell from their limbs the bristles which had grown 
All over them, when mighty Circe gave 
At first the baleful potion. Now again 475 

My friends were men, and younger than before, 
And of a nobler mien and statelier growth. 
They knew me all ; and each one pressed my hand 
In his, and there were tears and sobs of joy 
That sounded through the palace. Circe too 480 
Was moved, the mighty goddess ; she drew near 
And stood by me, and spake these winged words : — 

" 'Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise, 
Ulysses ! go to thy good ship beside 
The sea and draw it up the beach, and hide 485 

The goods and weapons in the caverns there, 
And come thou back and bring with thee thy friends.' 



Book X. 217 

" She spake, and easily my generous mind 
Was moved by what she said. Forthwith I went 
To my good ship beside the sea, and found 490 

My friends in tears, lamenting bitterly. 
As in some grange the calves come leaping round 
A herd of kine returning to the stall 
From grassy fields where they have grazed their fill, 
Nor can the stall contain the young which spring 495 
Around their mothers with continual bleat ; 
So when my comrades saw me through their tears, 
They sprang to meet me, and their joy was such 
As if they were in their own native land 
And their own city, on the rugged coast s«j 

Of Ithaca, where they were born and reared ; 
And as they wept they spake these winged words : — 

" ' O foster-child of Jove ! we welcome thee 
On thy return with a delight as great 
As if we all had reached again the land 505 

That gave us birth, our Ithaca. And now 
Tell by what death our other friends have died.' 

"They spake; I answered with consoling 
words : — 
'First draw our galley up the beach, and hide 
Our goods and all our weapons in the caves, s» 
And then let all make haste to follow me, 
And see our friends in Circe's sacred halls, 
Eating and drinking at the plenteous board.' 

" I spake ; and cheerfully my men obeyed, 
Save that Eurylochus alone essayed 5*5 

vol. 1. 10 



21 8 The Odyssey. 

To hold them back, and spake these winged words : — 

" ' Ah, whither are we going, wretched ones ? 
Are ye so eager for an evil fate, 
That ye must go where Circe dwells, who waits 
To turn us into lions, swine, or wolves, 520 

Forced to remain and guard her spacious house ? 
So was it with the Cyclops, when our friends 
Went with this daring chief to his abode, 
And perished there through his foolhardiness.' 

" He spake ; and then I thought to draw my 
sword 525 

From my stout thigh, and with the trenchant blade 
Strike off his head and let it fall to earth, 
Though he were my near kinsman ; yet the rest 
Restrained me, each one speaking kindly words : — 

" * Nay, foster-child of Jove ! if thou consent, 53c 
This man shall stay behind and with the ship, 
And he shall guard the ship, but lead us thou 
To where the sacred halls of Circe stand.' 

" They spake, and from the ship and shore went up 
Into the land, nor was Eurylochus 535 

Left with the ship ; he followed, for he feared 
My terrible threat. Meantime had Circe bathed 
My comrades at the palace, and with oil 
Anointed them, and robed them in fair cloaks 
And tunics. There we found them banqueting. **> 
When they and those who came with me beheld 
Each other, and the memory of the past 
Came back to them, they wept abundantly, 



Book X. 219 

And all the palace echoed with their sobs. 

And then the mighty goddess came and said : — 54s 

" ' Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise, 
Prolong thou not these sorrows. Well I know 
What ye have suffered on the fishy deep, 
And all the evil that malignant men 
Have done to you on land. Now take the food 550 
Before you, drink the wine, till ye receive 
Into your hearts the courage that was yours 
When long ago ye left your fatherland, 
The rugged Ithaca. Ye are unnerved 
And spiritless with thinking constantly sss 

On your long wanderings, and your minds allow 
No space for mirth, for ye have suffered much ' 

" She spake ; her words persuaded easily 
Our generous minds, and there from day to day 
We lingered a full year, and banqueted 560 

Nobly on plenteous meats and delicate wines. 
But when the year was ended, and the hours 
Renewed their circle, my beloved friends 
From Circe's palace called me forth and said : — 

" ' Good chief, do not forget thy native land, 56s 
If fate indeed permit that ever thou 
Return in safety to that lofty pile 
Thy palace in the country of thy birth. 

"So spake they, and my generous mind was moved. 
All that day long until the set of sun 57* 

We sat and feasted on the abundant meats 
And delicate wines ; and when the sun went down 



220 The Odyssey. 

They took their rest within the darkened halls, 
While I to Circe's sumptuous couch went up, 
A suppliant at her knees. The goddess heard 575 
My prayer, as thus in winged words I said : — 

" ' O Circe ! make, I pray, the promise good 
Which thou hast given, to send me to my home. 
My heart is pining for it, and the hearts 
Of all my friends, who weary out my life 5&> 

Lamenting round me when thou art not nigh.' 

" I spake ; the mighty goddess thus replied : — 
1 Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise, 
Ulysses ! ye must not remain with me 
Unwillingly * but ye have yet to make 585 

Another voyage, and must visit first 
The abode of Pluto, and of Proserpine 
His dreaded queen, and there consult the soul 
Of the blind seer Tiresias, — him of Thebes, — 
Whose intellect was spared ; for Proserpine 590 

Gave back to him in death the power of mind, 
That only he might know of things to come. 
The rest are shades that flit from place to place.' 

"Thus spake the goddess; and my heart was 
wrung 
With sorrow, and I sat upon the couch 595 

And wept, nor could I longer wish to live 
And see the light of day. But when my grief, 
With shedding tears and tossing where I sat, 
Was somewhat spent, I spake to Circe thus : — 

" ' O Circe, who will guide me when I make &*» 



Book X. 221 

This voyage ? for no galley built by man 
Has ever yet arrived at Pluto's realm.' 

" I spake ; the mighty goddess answered me : — 
1 Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise, 
Take thou no thought of who shall guide thy bark, 6o 5 
But raise the mast and spread the glimmering sail, 
And seat thyself, and let the north-wind waft 
Thy galley on. As soon as thou shalt cross 
Oceanus, and come to the low shore 
And groves of Proserpine, the lofty groups e w 

Of poplars, and the willows that let fall 
Their withered fruit, moor thou thy galley there 
In the deep eddies of Oceanus, 
And pass to Pluto's comfortless abode. 
There into Acheron are poured the streams d* 

Of Pyriphlegethon, and of that arm 
Of Styx, Cocytus. At the place where meet 
The ever-roaring waters stands a rock ; 
Draw near to that, and there I bid thee scoop 
In earth a trench, a cubit long and wide. 620 

And round about it pour to all the dead 
Libations, — milk and honey first, and next 
Rich wine, and lastly water, scattering 
White meal upon them. Offer there thy prayer 
Fervently to that troop of airy forms, 625 

And make the vow that thou wilt sacrifice, 
When thou at last shalt come to Ithaca, 
A heifer without blemish, barren yet, 
In thine own courts, and heap the altar-pyre 



222 The Odyssey. 

With things of price ; and to the seer alone, e* 

Tiresias, by himself, a ram whose fleece 
Is wholly black, the best of all thy flocks. 
And after thou hast duly offered prayer 
To all the illustrious nations of the dead, 
Then sacrifice a ram and a black ewe, 63s 

Their faces turned toward Erebus, but thine 
The other way and toward the river streams. 
Thither the souls of those who died will flock 
In multitudes. Then call thy friends, and give 
Command to flay in haste the sheep that lie 640 

Slain by the cruel brass, and, burning there 
The carcasses, pay worship to the gods, — 
The powerful Pluto and dread Proserpine. 
Draw then the sword upon thy thigh, and sit, 
And suffer none of all those airy forms « 4 s 

To touch the blood until thou first bespeak 
Tiresias. He will come, and speedily, — 
The leader of the people, — and will tell 
What voyage thou must make, what length of way 
Thou yet must measure, and will show thee how 630 
Thou mayst return across the fishy deep.' 

" She spake ; and while she spake the Morn 
looked forth 
Upon her golden throne. The Nymph bestowed 
On me a cloak and tunic, and arrayed 
Herself in a white robe with ample folds, — 6 5i 

A delicate web and graceful. Round her loins 
She clasped a shining zone of gold, and hung 



Book X. 223 

A veil upon her forehead. Forth I went 
Throughout the palace and aroused my friends, 
And thus I said in cheerful tones to each : — 6* 

" * No longer give yourselves to idle rest 
And pleasant slumber ; we are to depart. 
The gracious Circe counsels us to go.' 

" I spake, and easily their generous minds 
Inclined to me. Yet brought I not away «* 

All my companions safely from the isle. 
Elpenor was the youngest of our band, 
Not brave in war was he, nor wise in thought 
He, overcome with wine, and for the sake 
Of coolness, had lain down to sleep, apart 670 

From all the rest, in Circe's sacred house ; 
And as my friends bestirred themselves, the noise 
And tumult roused him ; he forgot to come 
By the long staircase ; headlong from the roof 
He plunged ; his neck was broken at the spine, 67s 
And his soul went to the abode of death. 

"My friends came round me, and I said to 
them : — 
1 Haply your thought may be that you are bound 
For the dear country of your birth ; but know 
That Circe sends us elsewhere, to consult 680 

The Theban seer, Tiresias, in the abode 
Of Pluto and the dreaded Proserpine.' 

"I spake, and their hearts failed them as they 
heard ; 
They sat them down, and wept, and tore their hair, 



224 The Odyssey. 

But fruitless were their sorrow and their tears. 68 S 

" Thus as we sadly moved to our good ship 
Upon the sea-shore, weeping all the while, 
Circe, meantime, had visited its deck, 
And there had bound a ram and a black ewe 
By means we saw not ; for what eye discerns 690 
The presence of a deity, who moves 
From place to place, and wills not to be seen ? "
