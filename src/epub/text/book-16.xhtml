MEANTIME Ulysses and that noble hind 
The swineherd, in the lodge, at early dawn, 
Lighted a fire, prepared a meal, and sent 
The herdsmen forth to drive the swine afield. 
The dogs, so apt to bark, came fawning round, s 
And barked not as Telemachus drew near. 
Ulysses heard the sound of coming feet, 
And marked the crouching dogs, and suddenly 
Bespake Eumaeus thus with winged words : — 

" Eumaeus, without doubt some friend of thine, » 
Or some one known familiarly, is near. 
There is no barking of the dogs ; they fawn 
Around him, and I hear the sound of feet." 

Scarce had he spoken, when within the porch 
Stood his dear son. The swineherd starting up, is 
Surprised, let fall the vessels from his hands 
In which he mingled the rich wines, and flew 
To meet his master ; kissed him on the brow ; 
Kissed both his shining eyes and both his hands, 
With many tears. As when a father takes » 

Into his arms a son whom tenderly 
He loves, returning from a distant land 
In the tenth year, — his only son, the child 
Of his old age, for whom he long has borne 
Hardship and grief, — so to Telemachus *» 

The swineherd clung, and kissed him o'er and o'er. 



Book XVI. 69 

As one escaped from death, and, shedding still 
Warm tears, bespake him thus with winged words : — 

" Thou comest, O Telemachus ! the light 
Is not more sweet to me. I never thought 30 

To see thee more when thou hadst once embarked 
For Pylos. Now come in, beloved child, 
And let my heart rejoice that once again 
I have thee here, so newly come from far. 
For 't is not often that thou visitest 35 

Herdsmen and fields, but dwellest in the town, — 
Such is thy will, — beholding day by day 
The wasteful pillage of the suitor-train." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 
" So be it, father ; for thy sake I came 40 

To see thee with these eyes, and hear thee speak 
And tell me if my mother dwells within 
The palace yet ; or has some wooer led 
The queen away, his bride, and does the couch 
Of great Ulysses lie untapestried, 45 

With ugly cobwebs gathering over it ? " 

And then the master swineherd spake in turn : 
fv Most true it is that with a constant mind 
The queen inhabits yet thy palace halls, 
And wastes in tears her wretched nights and days." 

So speaking he received his brazen lance, si 

And over the stone threshold passed the prince 
Into the lodge. Ulysses yielded up 
His seat to him ; Telemachus forbade. 

" Nay, stranger, sit ; it shall be ours to find 55 



yo The Odyssey. 

Elsewhere a seat in this our lodge, and he 
Who should provide it is already here." 

He spake ; Ulysses turned, and took again 
His place ; the swineherd made a pile of twigs 
And covered it with skins, on which sat down & 
The dear son of Ulysses. Next he brought 
Dishes of roasted meats which yet remained, 
Part of the banquet of the day before, 
And heaped the canisters with bread, and mixed 
The rich wines in a wooden bowl. He sat e 5 

Right opposite Ulysses. All put forth 
Their hands and shared the meats upon the board ; 
And when the calls of thirst and hunger ceased, 
Thus to the swineherd said Telemachus : — 

"Whence, father, is this stranger, and how 
brought 70 

By seamen to the coast of Ithaca ? 
And who are they that brought him ? — for I deem 
He came not over to our isle on foot." 

And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply : 
" True answer will I make to all. He claims 75 
To be a son of the broad isle of Crete, 
And says that in his wanderings he has passed 
Through many cities of the world, for so 
Some god ordained ; and now, escaped by flight 
From a Thesprotian galley, he has sought s# 

A refuge in my lodge. Into thy hands 
I give him ; deal thou with him as thou wilt. 
He is thy suppliant, and makes suit to thee." 



Book XVI. yi 

Then spake discreet Telemachus again : 
" Eumaeus, thou hast uttered words that pierce s s 
My heart with pain ; for how can I receive 
A stranger at my house ? I am a youth 
Who never yet has trusted in his arm 
To beat the offerer of an insult back. 
And in my mother's mind the choice i-s yet *> 

Uncertain whether to remain with me 
The mistress of my household, keeping still 
Her constant reverence for her husband's bed, 
And still obedient to the people's voice, 
Or whether she shall follow as a bride 9 s 

Him of the Achaian suitors in my halls 
Who is accounted worthiest, and who brings 
The richest gifts. Now, as to this thy guest, 
Since he has sought thy lodge, I give to him 
A cloak and tunic, seemly of their kind, »» 

A two-edged sword, and sandals for his feet. 
And I will send him to whatever coast 
He may desire to go. Yet, if thou wilt, 
Lodge him beneath thy roof, and I will send 
Raiment and food, that he may be no charge io 5 
To thee or thy companions. To my house 
Among the suitor-train I cannot bear 
That he should go. Those men are insolent 
Beyond all measure ; they would scoff at him, 
And greatly should I grieve. The boldest mas* «o 
Against so many might contend in vain, 
And greater is their power by far than mine." 



J2 The Odyssey. 

Then spake Ulysses, the great sufferer : 
" O friend, — since I have liberty to speak, — 
My very heart is wounded when I hear us 

What wrongs the suitors practise in thy halls 
Against a youth like thee. But give me leave 
To ask if thou submittest willingly, 
Or do thy people, hearkening to some god, 
Hate thee with open hatred ? Dost thou blame «o 
Thy brothers ? — for in brothers men confide 
Even in a desperate conflict. Would that I 
Were young again, and with the will I have, 
Or that I could become Ulysses' son, 
Or were that chief himself returned at last *& 

From all his wanderings, — and there yet is hope 
Of his return, — then might another strike 
My head off if I would not instantly 
Enter the house of Laertiades 

And make myself a mischief to them all. 13* 

But should they overcome me, thus alone 
Contending with such numbers, I would choose 
Rather in mine own palace to be slain 
Than every day behold such shameful deeds, — 
Insulted guests, maid-servants foully dragged 13s 
Through those fair palace chambers, wine-casks 

drained, 
And gluttons feasting idly, wastefully, 
And others toiling for them without end." 

Then spake again discreet Telemachus : 
" Stranger, thou shalt be answered faithfully. 140 



Book XVI. 73 

Know, then, the people are by no means wroth 

With me, nor have I brothers to accuse, 

Though in a desperate conflict men rely 

Upon a brother's aid. Saturnian Jove 

Confines our lineage to a single head. us 

The king Arcesius had an only son, 

Laertes, and to him was only born 

Ulysses ; and Ulysses left me here, 

The only scion of his house, and he 

Had little joy of me. Our halls are filled 15° 

With enemies, the chief men of the isles, — 

Dulichium, Samos, and Zacynthus dark 

With forests, and the rugged Ithaca, — 

So many woo my mother and consume 

Our substance. She rejects not utterly 15s 

Their hateful suit, nor yet will give consent 

And end it. They go on to waste my wealth, 

And soon will end me also ; but the event 

Rests with the gods. — And go thou now with 

speed, 
Eumaeus, father, to Penelope, 160 

And say that I am safe, and just returned 
From Pylos. I remain within the lodge. 
And then come back as soon as thou hast told 
The queen alone. Let none of all the Greeks 
Hear aught ; for they are plotting harm to me." 163 

Then thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply : 
" Enough, I see it all, thy words are said 
To one who understands them. But, I pray, 

VOL. 11. 



74 The Odyssey. 

Direct me whether in my way to take 

A message to Laertes, the distressed. 17* 

While sorrowing for Ulysses he o'ersaw 

The labors of the field, and ate and drank, 

As he had appetite, with those who wrought. 

But since thy voyage to the Pylian coast 

They say he never takes his daily meals 17s 

As he was wont, nor oversees the work, 

But sits and mourns and sighs and pines away, 

Until his limbs are shrivelled to the bone." 

Then spake discreet Telemachus again : 
"'T is sad, but we must leave him to his grief 180 
A little while. Could everything be made 
To happen as we mortals wish, I then 
Would first desire my father's safe return. 
But thou, when thou hast given thy message, haste 
Hither again, nor wander through the fields 185 

To him ; but let my mother send at once 
The matron of her household, privately, 
To bear the tidings to the aged man." 

He spake to speed the swineherd, who took up 
His sandals, bound them on, and bent his way 190 
Townward. Not unperceived by Pallas went 
Eumaeus from the lodge. She came in shape 
A woman beautiful and stately, skilled 
In household arts, the noblest. Near the gate 
She stood, right opposite. Ulysses saw ; 195 

Telemachus beheld her not ; the gods 
Not always manifest themselves to all. 



Book XVI. 75 

Ulysses and the mastiffs saw ; the dogs 

Barked not, but, whimpering, fled from her and 

sought 
The stalls within. She beckoned with her brows ; 200 
Ulysses knew her meaning and came forth, 
And passed the great wall of the court, and there 
Stood near to Pallas, who bespake him thus : — 

" Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise, 
Speak with thy son ; conceal from him the truth 20s 
No longer, that, prepared to make an end 
Of that vile suitor-crew, ye may go up 
Into the royal town. Nor long will I 
Be absent ; I am ready for the assault." 

Thus spake the goddess. Putting forth a wand 210 
Of gold, she touched the chief. Beneath that touch 
His breast was covered with a new-blanched robe 
And tunic. To his frame it gave new strength ; 
His swarthy color came again, his cheeks 
Grew full, and the beard darkened on his chin. 215 
This done, she disappeared. Ulysses came 
Into the lodge again ; his son beheld 
Amazed and overawed, and turned his eyes 
Away, as if in presence of a god, 
And thus bespake the chief with winged words : — ■ 22. 

" O stranger, thou art other than thou wert ; 
Thy garb is not the same, nor are thy looks ; 
Thou surely art some deity of those 
Whose habitation is the ample heaven. 
Be giacious to us, let us bring to thee »s 



J6 The Odyssey. 

Such sacrifices as thou wilt accept 
And gifts of graven gold ; be merciful." 

Ulysses, the great sufferer, thus replied : 
" I am no god ; how am I like the gods ? 
I am thy father, he for whom thy sighs 830 

Are breathed, and sorrows borne, and wrongs en- 
dured." 

He spake and kissed his son, and from his lids 
Tears fell to earth, that long had been restrained. 
And then Telemachus, who could not think 
The stranger was his father, answered thus : — 23s 

" Nay, thou art not my father, thou art not 
Ulysses ; rather hath some deity 
Sought to deceive me, that my grief may be 
The sharper ; for no mortal man would do 
What has been done, unless some god should come 
To aid him, and to make him young or old w 

At pleasure ; for thou wert a moment since 
An aged man, and sordidly arrayed, 
And now art like the gods of the wide heaven." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 24s 

" It is not well, Telemachus, to greet 
With boundless wonder and astonishment 
Thy father in this lodge. Be sure of this, 
That no Ulysses other than myself 
Will ever enter here. I, who am he, *»• 

Have suffered greatly and have wandered far, 
And in the twentieth year am come again 
To mine own land. Thou hast beheld to-day 



Book XVL 77 

A wonder wrought by Pallas, huntress-queen, 
Who makes me what she will, such power is hers, — 
Sometimes to seem a beggar, and in turn 256 

A young man in a comely garb. The gods 
Whose home is in the heavens can easily 
Exalt a mortal man, or bring him low." 

He spake and sat him down. Telemachus 260 
Around his glorious father threw his arms, 
And shed a shower of tears. Both felt at heart 
A passionate desire to weep ; they wept 
Aloud, — and louder were their cries than those 
Of eagles, or the sharp-clawed vulture tribe, 26s 

Whose young the hinds have stolen, yet unfledged. 
Still flowed their tears abundantly ; the sun 
Would have gone down and left them weeping still v 
Had not Telemachus at length inquired : — 

" Dear father, tell me in what galley came 270 
The mariners who brought thee. Of what race 
Claim they to be ? For certainly, I think, 
Thou cam'st not hither travelling on foot." 

Ulysses, the great sufferer, thus replied : 
" My son, thou shalt be answered faithfully. 273 

Men of a race renowned for seamanship, 
Phaeacians, brought me hither. They convey 
Abroad the strangers coming to their isle, 
And, bearing me in one of their swift barks 
Across the sea, they landed me asleep 28k 

In Ithaca. Rich were the gifts they gave, — 
Much brass and gold, and garments from the loom \ 



78 The Odyssey. 

These, so the gods have counselled, lie concealed 
Among the hollow rocks, and I am come, 
Obeying Pallas, to consult with thee a8 S 

How to destroy our enemies. Give now 
The number of the suitors ; let me know 
How many there may be, and who they are, 
That with a careful judgment I may weigh 
The question whether we shall fall on them, — 290 
We two alone, — or must we seek allies." 

Then spake discreet Telemachus again : 
" O father, I have heard of thy great fame 
My whole life long, — how mighty is thy arm, 
How wise thy counsels. Thou hast said great 
things, 29s 

And I am thunderstruck. It cannot be 
That two alone should stand before a crowd 
Of valiant men. They are not merely ten, — 
These suitors, — nor twice ten, but many more ; 
Hear, then, their number. From Dulichium come 3°° 
Fifty and two, the flower of all its youth, 
With whom are six attendants. Samos sends 
Twice twelve, and twenty more Achaian chiefs 
Come from Zacynthus. Twelve from Ithaca ; 
The noblest of the isle are these, — with whom 305 
Medon the herald comes, — a bard whose song 
Is heavenly, — and two servants skilled to spread 
The banquet. Should we in the palace halls 
Assault all these, I fear lest the revenge 
For all thy wrongs would end most bitterly 310 



Book XVI. ; 9 

And grievously for thee. Now, if thy thought 
Be turned to some ally, bethink thee who 
Will combat for us with a willing heart." 

Again Ulysses, the great sufferer, spake : 
" Then will I tell thee ; listen, and give heed. 315 
Think whether Pallas and her father, Jove, 
Suffice not for us. Need we more allies ? " 

And then discreet Telemachus rejoined : 
u Assuredly the twain whom thou hast named 
Are mighty as allies ; for though they sit 320 

On high among the clouds, they yet bear rule 
Both o'er mankind and o'er the living gods." 

Once more Ulysses, the great sufferer, spake : 
" Not long will they avoid the fierce affray 
When in my halls the strength of war is tried 325 
Between me and the suitor crew. Now go 
With early morning to thy home, and there 
Mingle among the suitors. As for me, 
The swineherd afterward shall lead me hence 
To town, a wretched beggar seemingly, 330 

And very old. If there they scoff at me 
In mine own palace, let thy faithful heart 
Endure it, though I suffer ; though they seize 
My feet, and by them drag me to the door, 
Or strike at me with weapon-blades, look on 335 
And bear it ; yet reprove with gentle words 
Their folly. They will never heed reproof; 
The day of their destruction is at hand. 
And this I tell thee further, and be sure 



80 The Odyssey. 

To keep my words in memory. As soon 340 

As Pallas, goddess of wise counsel, gives 

The warning, I shall nod to thee, and thou, 

When thou perceivest it, remove at once 

All weapons from my halls to a recess 

High in an upper chamber. With soft words 34s 

Quiet the suitors when they ask thee why. 

Say, ' I would take them where there comes no 

smoke, 
Since now they seem no longer like to those 
Left by Ulysses when he sailed for Troy, 
But soiled and tarnished by the breath of fire. 350 
This graver reason, also, Saturn's son 
Hath forced upon my mind, — that ye by chance, 
When full of wine and quarrelling, may wound 
Each other, and disgrace the feast, and bring 
Shame on your wooing ; for the sight of steel 355 
Draws men to bloodshed.' Say but this, and leave 
Two swords for us, two spears, two oxhide shields, 
Against the day of combat. Pallas then, 
And Jove the All-disposer, will unman 
Their hearts. Moreover, let me say to thee, — & 
And keep my words in memory, — if thou be 
My son, and of my blood, let no man hear 
That now Ulysses is within the isle ; 
Let not Laertes hear of it, nor him 
Who keeps the swine, nor any of the train 3*5 

Of servants, nor Penelope herself, 
While thou and I alone search out and prove 



Book XVI. 81 

The wometi J[ the household, and no less 

The serving-men, to know who honors us, 

And bears us reverence in his heart, and who 37* 

Contemns us, and dishonors even thee." 

Then answered his illustrious son and said : 
" Father, thou yet wilt know my heart, and find 
That of a careless and too easy mood 
I am not ; but a search like this, I think, 37s 

Would profit neither of us, and I pray 
That thou wilt well consider it. Long time 
Wouldst thou go wandering from place to place, 
O'er thy estates, to prove the loyalty 
Of every one, while in thy halls at ease 38° 

The suitors wastefully consume thy wealth. 
Yet would I counsel that the women's faith 
Be proved, that the disloyal may be marked 
And the innocent go free. As for the men, 
I would not now inquire from farm to farm ; 385 

That may be done hereafter, if indeed 
Thou hast a sign from aegis-bearing Jove." 

So talked they with each other. The good ship 
Which brought Telemachus and all his friends 
From Pylos kept meantime upon its way 390 

To Ithaca. There, entering the deep port, 
The seamen hauled the black ship up the beach ; 
And then the ready servants took away 
The arms, and to the house of Clytius bore 
The costly gifts. A herald from the ship 39s 

Went forward to the palace of the king 

4* F 



82 The Odyssey. 

With tidings to the sage Penelope 

That now her son was come and in the fields, 

And that the ship at his command had reached 

The city, lest the royal dame might feel 40a 

Fear for his safety, and give way to tears. 

The herald and the noble swineherd met, 

Each bearing the same message to the queen. 

Entering the palace of the godlike king, 

And standing midst the maids, the herald said : — 

" O lady, thy beloved son is come." 406 

But close beside the queen the swineherd stood, 
And told her everything which her dear son 
Had bid him say j and, having thus fulfilled 
His errand, left the palace and its court. 4*. 

Then were the suitors vexed and sorrowful, 
And going from the palace, and without 
The great wall that enclosed the court, sat down 
Before the gates, and there Eurymachus, 
The son of Polybus, harangued the throng : — 415 

" Behold, my friends, Telemachus has done 
A marvellous thing ; this voyage, which we thought 
He could not make, is made. Now let us launch 
A ship, the best that we can find, and man 
With fishermen the benches, sending it 420 

To find our friends, and hasten their return." 

Scarce had he spoken when Amphinomus, 
In turning where he stood, beheld a bark 
Enter the port's deep waters, with a crew 
That furled the sails and held the oars in hand. 425 



Book XVI. 83 

He laughed, well pleased, and to the suitors said : — 

" There needs no message to be sent, for they 
Are here already. Haply hath some god 
Given them the knowledge, or perchance they saw, 
But could not overtake, the prince's ship." 430 

He spake ; they rose and hastened to the strand, 
And quickly drew the galley up the beach. 
The ready servants bore the arms away ; 
Then met they all in council, suffering none 
Save of the suitor-train to meet with them, — 435 
None, either young or old. Eupeithes' son, 
Antinoiis, standing forth, bespake them thus : — 
" How strangely do the gods protect this man 
From evil ! All day long spy after spy 
Has sat and watched upon the airy heights, 440 

And when the sun was set we never slept 
On land, but ever in our gallant ship 
Sailed, waiting for the holy morn, and lay 
In constant ambush for Telemachus, 
To seize and to destroy him. Yet behold, 445 

Some deity has brought him home. And now 
Frame we a plan to cut off utterly 
Telemachus, and leave him no escape ; 
For certainly I think that while he lives 
The end we aim at cannot be attained. 4* 

Shrewd is the youth in counsel and device, 
And we no longer have, as once we had, 
The people's favor. Let us quickly act, 
Ere he can call a council of the Greeks. 



84 The Odyssey. 

That he will do without delay, and there 4ss 

Will rise in wrath to tell them how we planned 

His death by violence, and failed ; and they 

Who hear assuredly will not approve 

The plotted mischief. They may drive us forth 

With outrage from our country to a land ** 

Of strangers. Let us be the first to strike, 

And slay him in the fields or on the way, 

And, taking his possessions to ourselves, 

Share equally his wealth. Then may we give 

This palace to his mother, and the man & 

Whom she shall wed, whoever he may be. 

Or if this plan mislike you, and ye choose 

That he should live, and keep the fair estate 

That was his father's, let us not go on 

Thronging the palace to consume his wealth 470 

In revelry, but each with liberal gifts 

Woo her from his own dwelling ; and let him 

Who gives most generously, and whom fate 

Most favors, take the lady as his bride." 

He spake, and all were mute. Amphinomus, 475 
The illustrious son of royal Nisus, rose. 
The grandson of Aretias, it was he 
Who led the suitors from Dulichium's fields, 
Grassy and rich in corn. Penelope 
Liked best his words, for generous was his thought, 
And with a generous purpose thus he spake : — 4& 

" Nay, friends, not mine is the advice to slay 
Telemachus. It is a fearful thing 



Book XVI. 85 

To take a royal life. Then let us first 

Inquire the pleasure of the gods. For if 485 

The oracles of mighty Jupiter 

Approve it, I would do the deed myself, 

Or bid another do it ; but if they 

Consent not, 't is my counsel to forbear." 

He spake, and all approved. At once they rose, 
And, entering the palace, sat them down 491 

On shining thrones. Meantime Penelope 
Had formed the purpose to appear before 
The arrogant suitors, for the news was brought 
Into her chamber of the plot to slay 49s 

Her son ; the herald Medon overheard, 
And told her all. So to the hall she went 
With her attendant maids. The glorious dame 
Drew near the suitor-train, and took her stand 
Beside a column of the stately pile, 500 

And with a delicate veil before her cheeks 
Began to speak, and chid Antinous thus : — 

" Antinous, mischief-plotter, insolent ! 
The rumor is that thou excellest all 
Of thy own age among the Ithacans 505 

In understanding and in speech. Yet such 
Thou never wert. Ferocious as thou art, 
Why seek the death of my Telemachus, 
And treat with scorn the suppliants of whose prayer 
Jove is the witness ? An unholy thing s*> 

It is when men against their fellow-men 
Plot mischief. Dost thou then forget that once 



86 The Odyssey. 

Thy father came to us a fugitive, 
In terror of the people, who were wroth 
Because he joined the Taphian pirate-race, in 

And plundered the Thesprotians, our allies. 
The people would have slain him, and have torn 
His heart out, and have pillaged his large wealth ; 
Ulysses checked their rage, and held them back, 
Fierce as they were. Now thou dost waste his 
goods 520 

Most shamefully, and woo his wife, and slay 
His son, and multiply my woes. Cease now, 
I charge thee, and persuade the rest to cease." 

Eurymachus, the son of Polybus, 
Replied : " O daughter of Icarius, sage 52s 

Penelope, take heart ; let no such thought 
Possess thy mind. There is no man on earth, 
Nor will there be, who shall lay violent hands 
Upon Telemachus, thy son, while I 
Am living, and yet keep the gift of sight. 530 

I say, and will perform it, — his black blood 
Shall flow and bathe my spear. Ulysses oft, 
Spoiler of realms, would take me on his knee, 
And put the roasted meats into my hands, 
And give me ruddy wine. I therefore hold 535 

Telemachus of all mankind most dear, 
And I will bid him have no fear of death 
From any of the suitors. If it come, 
Sent by the gods, he cannot then escape." 

So spake he to appease her, while he planned, 54° 



Book XVL $7 

The murder of her son. The queen went up 
To the fair upper chambers, and there wept 
Ulysses, her dear spouse, till o'er her lids 
The blue-eyed Pallas poured the balm of sleep. 

At evening to Ulysses and his son 545 

The noble swineherd went, while busily 
They made the supper ready, having slain 
A porker one year old. Then instantly 
Stood Pallas by Ulysses, and put forth 
Her wand and touched him, making him again 55° 
Old, and clad sordidly in beggar's weeds, 
Lest that the swineherd, knowing at a look 
His master, might not keep the knowledge locked 
In his own breast, but, hastening forth, betray 
The secret to the chaste Penelope. 55s 

Then to the swineherd said Telemachus : 
" Noble Eumaeus, welcome ; what reports 
Are in the town ? Have those large-minded men, 
The suitors, left their ambush and returned, 
Or are they waiting yet for me to pass ? " 560 

And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply : 
" Of that, indeed, I never thought to ask, 
In going through the town. My only care 
Was to return, as soon as I had given 
My message, with such speed as I could make. 56s 
I met a messenger, a herald sent 
By thy companions, who was first to tell 
Thy mother of thy safe return. Yet this 
I know, for I beheld it with my eyes. 



88 The Odyssey. 

When outside of the city, where the hill 57* 

Of Hermes stands, I saw a gallant bark 
Entering the port, and carrying many men. 
Heavy it was with shields and two-edged spears ; 
'T was they, I thought, and yet I cannot tell." 

He spake ; Telemachus the valiant looked 575 
Upon his father with a smile unmarked 
By good Eumaeus. When their task was done, 
And the board spread, they feasted. No one 

lacked 
His portion of the common meal. Their thirst 
And hunger satisfied, they laid them down <$» 

To rest, and so received the gift of sleep.
