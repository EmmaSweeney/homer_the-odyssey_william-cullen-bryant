" \T OW when our bark had left Ocdanus 
1. tI And entered the great deep, we reached 
the isle 
/Esea, where the Morning, child of Dawn, 
Abides, and holds her dances, and the Sun 
Goes up from earth. We landed there and drew s 
Our galley up the beach ; we disembarked 
And laid us down to sleep beside the sea, 
And waited for the holy Morn to rise. 

" Then when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared, 
The child of Dawn, I sent my comrades forth » 
To bring from Circe's halls Elpenor's corse. 
And where a headland stretched into the deep 



Book XII 253 

(We hewed down trees, and held the funeral rites 
With many tears ; and having there consumed 
I The body and the arms with fire, we built 
A tomb, and reared a column to the dead, 
And on its summit fixed a tapering oar. 

•" All this was duly done ; yet was the news 
Of our return from Hades not concealed 
From Circe. She attired herself in haste * 

And came ; her maids came with her, bringing bread 
And store of meats and generous wine ; and thus 
Spake the wise goddess, standing in the midst : — 

" * Ah, daring ones ! who, yet alive, have gone 
Down to the abode of Pluto ; twice to die as 

Is yours, while others die but once. Yet now 
Take food, drink wine, and hold a feast to-day, 
And with the dawn of morning ye shall sail ; 
And I will show the way, and teach you all 
Its dangers, so that ye may not lament 30 

False counsels followed, either on the land 
Or on the water, to your grievous harm.' 

" She spake, and our confiding minds were swayed 
Easily by her counsels. All that day 
Till set of sun we sat and banqueted 35 

Upon the abundant meats and generous wines ; 
And when the Sun went down, and darkness came, 
The crew beside the fastenings of our bark 
Lay down to sleep, while Circe took my hand, 
Led me apart, and made me sit, and took «» 

Her seat before me, and inquired of all 



254 The Odyssey. 

That I had seen. I told her faithfully, 
And then the mighty goddess Circe said : — 
" ' Thus far is well ; now needfully attend 
To what I say, and may some deity 45 

Help thee remember it ! Thou first wilt come 
To where the Sirens haunt. They throw a spell 
O'er all who pass that way. If unawares 
One finds himself so nigh that he can hear 
Their voices, round him nevermore shall wife s* 
And lisping children gather, welcoming 
His safe return with joy. The Sirens sit 
In a green field, and charm with mellow notes 
The comer, while beside them lie in heaps 
The bones of men decaying underneath 55 

The shrivelled skins. Take heed and pass them by. 
First fill with wax well kneaded in the palm 
The ears of thy companions, that no sound 
May enter. Hear the music, if thou wilt, 
But let thy people bind thee, hand and foot, 60 

To the good ship, upright against the mast, 
And round it wind the cord, that thou mayst hear 
The ravishing notes. But shouldst thou then entreat 
Thy men, commanding them to set thee free, 
Let them be charged to bind thee yet more fast es 
With added bands. And when they shall have passed 
The Sirens by, I will not judge for thee 
Which way to take ; consider for thyself ; 
I tell thee of two ways. There is a pile 
Of beetling rocks, where roars the mighty surge 70 



Book XII 255 

Of dark-eyed Amphitrite ; these are called 

The Wanderers by the blessed gods. No birds 

Can pass them safe, not even the timid doves, 

Which bear ambrosia to our father Jove, 

But ever doth the slippery rock take off 73 

Some one, whose loss the God at once supplies, 

To keep their number full. To these no bark 

Guided by man has ever come, and left 

The spot unwrecked ; the billows of the deep 

And storms of fire in air have scattered wide sc 

Timbers of ships and bodies of drowned men. 

One only of the barks that plough the deep 

Has passed them safely, — Argo, known to all 

By fame, when coming from ^Eagta home, — 

And her the billows would have dashed against v 

The enormous rocks, if Juno, for the sake 

Of Jason, had not come to guide it through. 

" ' Two are the rocks ; one lifts to the broad heaver* 
Its pointed summit, where a dark gray cloud 
Broods, and withdraws not ; never is the sky <*» 
Clear o'er that peak, not even in summer days 
Or autumn ; nor can man ascend its steeps, 
Or venture down, — so smooth the sides, as if 
Man's art had polished them. There in the mids' 
Upon the western side toward Erebus » 

There yawns a shadowy cavern ; thither thou, 
Noble Ulysses, steer thy bark, yet keep 
So far aloof that, standing on the deck, 
A. youth might send an arrow from a bow 



256 The Odyssey. 

Just to the cavern's mouth. There Scylla dwells, i<* 
And fills the air with fearful yells ; her voice 
The cry of whelps just littered, but herself 
A frightful prodigy, — a sight which none 
Would care to look on, though he were a god. 
Twelve feet are hers, all shapeless ; six long necks, 105 
A hideous head on each, and triple rows 
Of teeth, close set and many, threatening death. 
And half her form is in the cavern's womb, 
And forth from that dark gulf her heads are thrust, 
To look abroad upon the rocks for prey, — »o 

Dolphin, or dogfish, or the mightier whale, 
Such as the murmuring Amphitrite breeds 
In multitudes. No mariner can boast 
That he has passed by Scylla with a crew 
Unharmed ; she snatches from the deck, and bears 
Away in each grim mouth, a living man. no 

" ' Another rock, Ulysses, thou wilt see, 
Of lower height, so near her that a spear, 
Cast by the hand, might reach it. On it grows 
A huge wild fig-tree with luxuriant leaves. mo 

Below, Charybdis, of immortal birth, 
Draws the dark water down ; for thrice a day 
She gives it forth, and thrice with fearful whirl 
She draws it in. O, be it not thy lot 
To come while the dark water rushes down ! 12s 
Even Neptune could not then deliver thee. 
Then turn thy course with speed toward Scylla's rock, 
And pass that way ; 't were better far that six 



Book XII. 257 

Should perish from the ship than all be lost/ 

" She spake, and I replied : ' O goddess, deign 130 
To tell me truly, cannot I at once 
Escape Charybdis and defend my friends 
Against the rage of Scylla when she strikes ? ' 

" I spake ; the mighty goddess answered me : — 
1 Rash man ! dost thou still think of warlike deeds, 
And feats of strength ? And wilt thou not give way 
Even to the deathless gods ? That pest is not 137 
Of mortal mould ; she cannot die, she is 
A thing to tremble and to shudder at, 
And fierce, and never to be overcome. 140 

There is no room for courage ; flight is best. 
And if thou shouldst delay beside the rock 
To take up arms, I fear lest once again 
She fall on thee with all her heads, and seize 
As many men. Pass by the monster's haunt us 
With all the speed that thou canst make, and call 
Upon Crataeis, who brought Scylla forth 
To be the plague of men, and who will calm 
Her rage, that she assault thee not again. 

" * Then in thy voyage shalt thou reach the isle 1? 
Trinacria, where, in pastures of the Sun, 
His many beeves and fading sheep are fed, — 
Seven herds of oxen, and as many flocks 
Of sheep, and fifty in each flock and herd. 
They never multiply ; they never die. *s 

Two shepherdesses tend them, goddesses, 
Nymphs with redundant locks, — Lampelia one, 

Q 



258 The Odyssey. 

The other Phaethusa. These the nymph 

Naeera to the overgoing Sun 

Brought forth, and when their queenly mother's r-are 

Had reared them, she appointed them to dwell ^t 

In far Trinacria, there to keep the flocks 

And oxen of their father. If thy thoughts 

Be fixed on thy return, so that thou leave 

These flocks and herds unharmed, ye all will come ics 

To Ithaca, though after many toils. 

But if thou rashly harm them, I foretell 

Destruction to thy ship and all its crew ; 

And if thyself escape, thou wilt return 

Late and in sorrow, all thy comrades lost.' *#> 

" She spake ; the Morning on her golden throne 
Looked forth ; the glorious goddess went her way 
Into the isle, I to my ship, and bade 
The men embark and cast the hawsers loose. 
And straight they went on board, and duly manned 
The benches, smiting as they sat with oars *?s 

The hoary waters. Circe, amber-haired, 
The mighty goddess of the musical voice, 
Sent a fair wind behind our dark-prowed ship 
That gayly bore us company, and filled ise 

The sails. When we had fairly ordered all 
On board our galley, we sat down, and left 
The favoring wind and helm to bear us on, 
And thus in sadness I bespake the crew : — 

" ' My friends ! it were not well that one or two 185 
Hone should know the oracles I heard 



Book XIL 259 

From Circe, great among the goddesses ; 

And now will I disclose them, that ye all, 

Whether we are to die or to escape 

The doom of death, may be forewarned. And first 

Against the wicked Sirens and their song x* 

And flowery bank she warns us. I alone 

May hear their voice, but ye must bind me first 

With bands too strong to break, that I may stand 

Upright against the mast ; and let the cords 193 

Be fastened round it. If I then entreat 

And bid you loose me, make the bands more strong/ 

" Thus to my crew I spake, and told them all 
That they should know, while our good ship drew 

near 
The island of the Sirens, prosperous gales 200 

Wafting it gently onward. Then the breeze 
Sank to a breathless calm ; some deity 
Had hushed the winds to slumber. Straightway rose 
The men and furled the sails and laid them down 
Within the ship, and sat and made the sea ao 3 

White with the beating of their polished blades, 
Made of the fir-tree. Then I took a mass 
Of wax and cut it into many parts, 
And kneaded each with a strong hand. It grew 
Warm with the pressure, and the beams of him *a 
Who journeys round the earth, the monarch Sun. 
With this I filled the ears of all my men 
From first to last. They bound me, in their turn, 
Upright against the mast-tree, hand and foot, 



%6o The Odyssey. 

And tied the cords around it. Then again »ij 

They sat and threshed with oars the hoary deep. 
And when, in running rapidly, we came 
So near the Sirens as to hear a voice 
From where they sat, our galley flew not by 
Unseen by them, and sweetly thus they sang : — 2» 

" ' O world-renowned Ulysses ! thou who art 
The glory of the Achaiansj turn thy bark 
Landward, that thou mayst listen to our lay 
No man has passed us in his galley yet, 
Ere he has heard our warbled melodies. 
He goes delighted hence a wiser man ~; 
For all that in the spacious realm of Troy 
The Greeks and Trojans by the will of Heaven 
Endured we know, and all that comes to pass 
In all the nations of the fruitful earth.' 230 

" 'T was thus they sang, and sweet the strain. 
I longed 
To listen, and with nods I gave the sign 
To set me free ; they only plied their oars 
The faster. Then upsprang Eurylochus 
And Perimedes, and with added cords 235 

Bound me, and drew the others still more tight. 
And when we now had passed the spot, and heard 
No more the melody the Sirens sang, 
My comrades hastened from their ears to take 
The wax, and loosed the cords and set me free. ** 

" As soon as we had left the isle, I saw 
Mist and a mountain billow, and I heard 



Book XII. 261 

The thunder of the waters. From the h;»nds 

Of my affrighted comrades flew the oars, 

The deep was all in uproar ; but the ship <m 

Stopped there, for all the rowers ceased their task. 

I went through all the ship exhorting them 

With cheerful words, man after man, and said : — 

" * Reflect, my friends, that we are not untried 
In evil fortunes, nor in sadder plight 250 

Are we than when within his spacious cave 
The brutal Cyclops held us prisoners ; 
Yet through my valor we escaped, and through 
My counsels and devices, and I think 
That ye will live to bear this day's events 255 

In memory like those. Now let us act. 
Do all as I advise ; go to your seats 
Upon the benches, smiting with your oars 
These mighty waves, and haply Jove will grant 
That we escape the death which threatens us. 260 
Thee, helmsman, I adjure, — and heed my words, 
Since to thy hands alone is given in charge 
Our gallant vessel's rudder, — steer thou hence 
From mist and tumbling waves, and well observe 
The rock, lest where it juts into the sea 265 

Thou heed it not, and bring us ail to wreck/ 

" I spake, and quickly all obeyed my words. 
Yet said I naught of Scylla, — whom we now 
Could not avoid, — lest all the crew in fear 
Should cease to row, and crowd into the hold. 270 
And then did I forget the stern command 



262 The Odyssey. 

Which Circe gave me, not to arm myself 

For combat. In my shining arms I cased 

My limbs, and took in hand two ponderous spears, 

And went on deck, and stood upon the prow, — 2-5 

For there it seemed to me that Scylla first 

Would show herself, — that monster of the rocks, — 

To seize my comrades. Yet I saw her not, 

Though weary grew my eyes with looking long 

And eagerly upon those dusky cliffs. 280 

" Sadly we sailed into the strait, where stood 
On one hand Scylla, and the dreaded rock 
Charybdis on the other, drawing down 
Into her horrid gulf the briny flood ; 
And as she threw it forth again, it tossed 28s 

And murmured as upon a glowing fire 
The water in a caldron, while the spray, 
Thrown upward, fell on both the summit-rocks ; 
And when once more she swallowed the salt sea, 
It whirled within the abyss, while far below 290 

The bottom of blue sand was seen. My men 
Grew pale with fear ; we looked into the gulf 
And thought our end was nigh. Then Scylla 

snatched 
Six of my comrades from our hollow bark, 
The best in valor and in strength of arm. 295 

I looked to my good ship ; I looked to them, 
And saw their hands and feet still swung in air 
Above me, while for the last time on earth 
They called my name in agony of heart 



Book XII 263 

As when an angler on a jutting rock 30° 

Sits with his taper rod, and casts his bait 
To snare the smaller fish, he sends the horn 
Of a wild bull that guards his line afar 
Into the water, and jerks out a fish, 
And throws it gasping shoreward ; so were they 30s 
Uplifted gasping to the rocks, and there 
Scylla devoured them at her cavern's mouth, 
Stretching their hands to me with piercing cries 
Of anguish. 'T was in truth the saddest sight, 
Whatever I have suffered and where'er 310 

Have roamed the waters, that mine eyes have seen. 

" Escaping thus the rocks, the dreaded haunt 
Of Scylla and Charybdis, we approached 
The pleasant island of the Sun, where grazed 
The oxen with broad foreheads, beautiful, 315 

And flocks of sheep, the fatlings of the god 
Who makes the round of heaven. While yet at sea 
I heard from my black ship the low of herds 
In stables, and the bleatings of the flocks, 
And straightway came into my thought the words 3*> 
Of the blind seer Tiresias, him of Thebes, 
And of ^Eaean Circe, who had oft 
Warned me to shun the island of the god 
Whose light is sweet to all. And then I said 
To my companions with a sorrowing heart : — 325 

" ' My comrades, sufferers as ye are, give ear* 
I shall disclose the oracles which late 
Tiresias and ^aean Circe gave. 



264 The Odyssey. 

The goddess earnestly admonished me 

Not to approach the island of the Sun, 33* 

Whose light is sweet to all, for there she said 

Some great misfortune lay in wait for us. 

Now let us speed the ship and pass the isle/ 

" I spake ; their hearts were broken as they heard, 
And bitterly Eurylochus replied : — 33s 

" ' Austere art thou, Ulysses ; thou art strong 
Exceedingly \ no labor tires thy limbs ; 
They must be made of iron, since thy will 
Denies thy comrades, overcome with toil 
And sleeplessness, to tread the land again, 340 

And in that isle amid the waters make 
A generous banquet. Thou wouldst have us sail 
Into the swiftly coming night, and stray 
Far from the island, through the misty sea. 
By night spring up the mighty winds that make 34s 
A wreck of ships, and how can one escape 
Destruction, should a sudden hurricane 
Rise from the south or the hard-blowing west, 
Such as, in spite of all the sovereign gods, 
Will cause a ship to founder in the deep ? 350 

Let us obey the dark-browed Night, and take 
Our evening meal, remaining close beside 
Our gallant bark, and go on board again 
When morning breaks, and enter the wide sea.' 

" So spake Eurylochus ; the rest approved. 35s 
And then I knew that some divinity 
Was meditating evil to our band, 



Book XIL 265 

And I bespake him thus in winged words : — 

" ' Eurylochus, ye force me to your will, 
Since I am only one. Now all of you sso 

Bind yourselves to me firmly, by an oath, 
That if ye haply here shall meet a herd 
Of beeves or flock of sheep, ye will not dare 
To slay a single ox or sheep, but feed 
Contented on the stores that Circe gave.' 365 

" I spake, and readily my comrades swore 
As I required ; and when that solemn oath 
Was taken, to the land we brought and moored 
Our galley in a winding creek, beside 
A fountain of sweet water. From the deck 370 

Stepped my companions and made ready there 
Their evening cheer. They ate and drank till thirst 
And hunger were appeased, and then they thought 
Of those whom Scylla from our galley's deck 
Snatched and devoured; they thought and wept 

till sleep 375 

Stole softly over them amid their tears. 
Now came the third part of the night ; the stars 
Were sinking when the Cloud-compeller Jove 
Sent forth a violent wind with eddying gusts, 
And covered both the earth and sky with clouds, 3&> 
And darkness fell from heaven. When Morning 

came, 
The rosy-fingered daughter of the Dawn, 
We drew the ship into a spacious grot. 
There were the seats of nymphs, and there we saw 
vol. 1. 12 



266 The Odyssey. 

The smooth fair places where they danced. I called 
A council of my men, and said to them : — 33s 

" ' My friends, in our good ship are food and 
drink ; 
Abstain we from these beeves, lest we be made 
To suffer ; for these herds and these fair flocks 
Are sacred to a dreaded god, the Sun, — 3<*> 

The all-beholding and all-hearing Sun.' 

" I spake, and all were swayed by what I said 
Full easily. A month entire the gales 
Blew from the south, and after that no wind 
Save east and south. While yet we had our bread 39s 
And ruddy wine, my comrades spared the beeves, 
Moved by the love of life. But when the stores 
On board our galley were consumed, they roamed 
The island in their need, and sought for prey, 
And snared with barbed hooks the fish and 
birds, — 400 

Whatever came to hand, — till they were gaunt 
With famine. Meantime I withdrew alone 
Into the isle, to supplicate the gods, 
If haply one of them might yet reveal 
The way of my return. As thus I strayed 405 

Into the land, apart from all the rest, 
I found a sheltered nook where no wind came, 
And prayed with washen hands to all the gods 
Who dwell in heaven. At length they bathed my lids 
In a soft sleep. Meantime, Eurylochus & 

With fatal counsels thus harangued my men : — 



Book XII. 26; 

" ' Hear, my companions, sufferers as ye are, 
The words that I shall speak. All modes of death 
Are hateful to the wretched race of men ; 
But this of hunger, thus to meet our fate, 415 

Is the most fearful. Let us drive apart 
The best of all the oxen of the Sun, 
And sacrifice them to the immortal ones 
Who dwell in the broad heaven. And if we come 
To Ithaca, our country, we will there **> 

Build to the Sun, whose path is o'er our heads, 
A sumptuous temple, and endow its shrine 
With many gifts and rare. But if it be 
His will, approved by all the other gods, 
To sink our bark in anger, for the sake 42s 

Of these his high-horned oxen, I should choose 
Sooner to gasp my life away amid 
The billows of the deep, than pine to death 
By famine in this melancholy isle.' 

" So spake Eurylochus ; the crew approved. 430 
Then from the neighboring herd they drove the best 
Of all the beeves ; for near the dark-prowed ship 
The fair broad-fronted herd with crooked horns 
Were feeding. Round the victims stood my crew, 
And, offering their petitions to the gods, 435 

Held tender oak-leaves in their hands, just plucked 
From a tall tree, for in our good ship's hold 
Was no white barley now. When they had prayed, 
And slain and dressed the beeves, they hewed away 
The thighs and covered them with double folds 44° 



268 The Odyssey. 

Of caul, and laid raw slices over these. 

Wine had they not to pour in sacrifice 

Upon the burning flesh ; they poured instead 

Water, and roasted all the entrails thus. 

Now when the thighs were thoroughly consumed, 

And entrails tasted, all the rest was carved *& 

Into small portions, and transfixed with spits. 

" Just then the gentle slumber left my lids. 
I hurried to the shore and my good ship, 
And, drawing near, perceived the savory steam 450 
From the burnt-offering. Sorrowfully then 
I called upon the ever-living gods : — 

" ' O Father Jove, and all ye blessed gods, 
Who live forever, 't was a cruel sleep 
In which ye lulled me to my grievous harm ; 455 
My comrades here have done a fearful wrong.' 

* Lampetia, of the trailing robes, in haste 
Flew to the Sun, who journeys round the earth, 
To tell him that my crew had slain his beeves, 
And thus in anger he bespake the gods : — 4&> 

" ' O Father Jove, and all ye blessed gods 
Who never die, avenge the wrong I bear 
Upon the comrades of Laertes' son, 
Ulysses, who have foully slain my beeves, 
In which I took delight whene'er I rose 465 

Into the starry heaven, and when again 
I sank from heaven to earth. If for the wrong 
They make not large amends, I shall go down 
To Hades, there to shine among the dead.' 



Book XII. 260 

" The cloud-compelling Jupiter replied : — 470 
: Still shine, O Sun ! among the deathless gods 
And mortal men, upon the nourishing earth. 
Soon will I cleave, with a white thunderbolt, 
Their galley in the midst of the black sea.' 

" This from Calypso of the radiant hair 475 

I heard thereafter ; she herself, she said, 
Had heard it from the herald Mercury. 

" When to the ship I came, beside the sea, 
I sternly chid them all, man after man, 
Yet could we think of no redress ; the beeves 480 
Were dead ; and now with prodigies the gods 
Amazed my comrades, — the skins moved and 

crawled, 
The flesh both raw and roasted on the spits 
Lowed with the voice of oxen. Six whole days 
My comrades feasted, taking from the herd 485 

The Sun's best oxen. When Saturnian Jove 
Brought the seventh day, the tempest ceased ; the 

wind 
Fell, and we straightway went on board. We set 
The mast upright, and, spreading the white sails, 
We ventured on the great wide sea again. 490 

" When we had left the isle, and now appeared 
No other land, but only sea and sky, 
The son of Saturn caused a lurid cloud 
To gather o'er the galley, and to cast 
Its darkness on the deep. Not long our ship 495 
Ran onward, ere the furious west-wind rose 



•270 The Odyssey. 

And blew a hurricane. A strong blast snapped 
Both ropes that held the mast ; the mast fell 

back ; 
The tackle dropped entangled to the hold \ 
The mast, in falling on the galley's stern, 500 

Dashed on the pilot's head and crushed the bones, 
And from the deck he plunged like one who dives 
Into the deep ; his gallant spirit left 
The limbs at once. Jove thundered from on high, 
And sent a thunderbolt into the ship, 505 

That, quaking with the fearful blow, and filled 
With stifling sulphur, shook my comrades off 
Into the deep. They floated round the ship 
Like seamews ; Jupiter had cut them off 
From their return. I moved from place to place, 
Still in the ship, until the tempest's force s» 

Parted the sides and keel. Before the waves 
The naked keel was swept. The mast had snapped 
Just at the base, but round it was a thong 
Made of a bullock's hide ; with this I bound 51s 
The mast and keel together, took my seat 
Upon them, and the wild winds bore me on. 

" The west-wind ceased to rage ; but in its 

stead 
The south-wind blew, and brought me bitter grief. 
I feared lest I must measure back my way 52a 

To grim Charybdis. All night long I rode 
The waves, and with the rising sun drew near 
The rock of Scylla and the terrible 



Book XII 271 

Charybdis as her gulf was drawing down 

The waves of the salt sea. There as I came 52s 

I raised myself on high till I could grasp 

The lofty fig-tree, and I clung to it 

As clings a bat, — for I could neither find 

A place to plant my feet, nor could I climb, 

So distant were the roots, so far apart 530 

The long huge branches overshadowing 

Charybdis. Yet I firmly kept my hold 

Till she should throw the keel and mast again 

Up from the gulf. They, as I waited long, 

Came up again, though late, — as late as one 535 

Who long has sat adjudging strifes between 

Young suitors pleading in the market-place 

Rises and goes to take his evening meal ; 

So late the timbers of my bark returned, 

Thrown from Charybdis. Then f dropped amid 540 

The dashing waves, and came with hands and 

feet 
On those long timbers in the midst, that they 
Might bear my weight. I sat on them and rowed 
With both my hands. The father of the gods 
And mortals suffered not that I should look 545 

On Scylla's rock again, else had I not 
Escaped a cruel death. For nine long days 
I floated on the waters ; on the tenth 
The gods at nightfall bore me to an isle, — 
Ogygia, where Calypso, amber-haired, 550 

A mighty goddess, skilled in song, abides, 



272 The Odyssey. 

Who kindly welcomed me, and cherished me. 
Why should I speak of this ? Here in these halls 
I gave the history yesterday to thee 
And to thy gracious consort, and I hate ss: 

To tell again a tale once fully told."
