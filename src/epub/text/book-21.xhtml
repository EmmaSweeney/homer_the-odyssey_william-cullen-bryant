PALLAS, the goddess of the azure eyes, 
Woke in the mind of sage Penelope, 
The daughter of Icarius, this design, — 
To put into the suitors' hands the bow 
And gray steel rings, and to propose a game s 

That in the palace was to usher in 
The slaughter. So she climbed the lofty stair, 
Up from the hall, and took in her plump hand 
The fair carved key ; its wards were wrought of brass, 
And ivory was the handle. Soon she reached 10 
The furthest room with her attendant maids. 
There lay the treasures of Ulysses, — brass 
And gold, and steel divinely wrought. There lay 
His bow unstrung ; there lay his quiver charged 
With arrows ; many were the deadly shafts *s 

It h > a stranger's gift, who met him once 



Book XXL 177 

In Lacedaemon, Iphitus by name, 
The son of Eurytus, and like the gods 
In presence. In Messene met the twain, 
And in the mansion of Orsilochus, » 

The warlike. Thither had Ulysses come 
To claim a debt from all the region round ; 
For rovers from Messene to their ships 
Had driven and carried off from Ithaca 
Three hundred sheep and those who tended them. »s 
For this Ulysses, though a stripling yet, 
Came that long voyage, on an embassy, 
Sent by his father and the other chiefs. 
And Iphitus had come in search of steeds 
Which he had lost, — twelve mares, and under them 
Twelve hardy mules, their foals. That errand 
brought 31 

The doom of death upon him. For he came, 
In journeying, to the abode of Hercules, 
The mighty hero-son of Jupiter, 
Famed for his labors, who, in his own house, 35 
Slew Iphitus, the stranger. Cruel wretch ! 
Who reverenced not the vengeance of the gods, 
Nor what was due to his own board, at which 
He placed his guest, and slew him afterward, 
And in his stables kept the goodly mares. & 

'T was when this guest was seeking for his steeds 
He met Ulysses, and bestowed on him 
The bow, which mighty Eurytus once bore, 
And dying in his lofty palace left 
8* 



178 The Odyssey. 

The weapon to his son. Ulysses gave 45 

In turn a trenchant sword and massive lance, 

A pledge of kindly hospitality, 

Begun, but not continued till they sat 

Each at the other's table ; for the son 

Of Jove first took the life of him who gave s« 

The bow, the godlike son of Eurytus. 

That bow Ulysses, when he went to war 

In his black galleys, never took with him, 

But left it in his palace, to be kept 

In memory of a beloved friend, 55 

And only bore it in his own domain. 

Now when the glorious lady reached the room, 
And stood upon the threshold, wrought of oak 
And polished by the workman's cunning hand, 
Who stretched the line upon it, and set up <* 

Its posts, and hung its shining doors, she loosed 
With a quick touch the thong that held the ring. 
Put in the key, and with a careful aim 
Struck back the sounding bolts. As when a bull 
Roars in the field, such sound the beautiful doors, 
Struck with the key, gave forth, and instantly &> 
They opened to her. Up the lofty floor 
She stepped, where stood the coffer that contained 
The perfumed garments. Reaching forth her hand, 
The queen took down the bow, that hung within ?• 
Its shining case, and sat her down, and laid 
The case upon her knees, and, drawing forth 
The monarch's bow, she wept aloud. As soon 



Book XXL 179 

As that new gush of tears had ceased to fall, 
Back to the hall she went, and that proud throng 75 
Of suitors, bearing in her hand the bow 
Unstrung, and quiver, where the arrows lay 
Many and deadly. Her attendant maids 
Brought also down a coffer, where were laid 
Much brass and steel, provided by the king *, 

For games like these. The glorious lady then, 
In presence of the suitors, stood beside 
The columns that upheld the stately roof. 
She held a lustrous veil before her cheeks, 
And, while on either side of her a maid s s 

Stood modestly, bespake the suitors thus : — 

" Hear, noble suitors ! ye who throng these halls, 
And eat and drink from day to day, while long 
My husband has been gone ; your sole excuse 
For all this lawlessness the claim ye make 90 

That I become a bride. Come then, for now 
A contest is proposed. I bring to you 
The mighty bow that great Ulysses bore. 
Whoe'er among you he may be whose hand 
Shall bend this bow, and send through these twelve 
rings 95 

An arrow, him I follow hence, and leave 
This beautiful abode of my young years, 
With all its plenty, — though its memory, 
I think, will haunt me even in my dreams." 

She spake, and bade the master of the swine, «* 
The good Eumaeus, place the bow and rings 



180 The Odyssey. 

Of hoary steel before the suitor-train. 

In tears he bore the bow and la|$ it down. 

The herdsman also wept to see again 

His master's bow. Antinous called to both 

With a loud voice, and chid them angrily : — 

" Ye silly rustics, who can never see 
Beyond the hour, why trouble with your tears 
The lady who had grief enough besides 
For her lost husband ? Sit and share the feast 
In silence, or go forth and leave the bow; 
A difficult contest it will be for us, 
Nor, as I think, will this fair bow be bent 
With ease, since surely there is no man here 
Such as Ulysses was. I saw him once, 
While but a child, and still remember him." 

He spake, yet in his secret heart believed 
That he should bend the bow, and send a shaft 
Through all the rings. And yet he was the first 
To taste the steel, — an arrow from the hand 
Of the great chief Ulysses, — whom he wronged 
In his own palace, and to equal wrong 
Encouraged others. Then Telemachus 
Rose in his sacred might, and thus began : — 

" Alas ! it must be that Saturnian Jove 
Has made me lose my wits. Wise as she is, 
My mother promises to leave her home 
And follow some one else, and yet I laugh, 
And am delighted in my foolish heart. 
Come then, since such a contest is proposed, 



Book XXL 181 

Ye suitors ! and for such a woman too. 

The like is not in all the lands of Greece, 

Argos, Mycenae, or the hallowed shore 

Of Pylos, or in Ithaca itself, 

Or the dark mainland coast. Ye know it well ; 13s 

Why should I praise my mother ? Come then, all ; 

Let there be no excuses for delay, 

Nor longer leave the bow untried, that we 

May see the event. I too am moved to try ; 

And if I bend the bow, and send a shaft ho 

Through all the rings, my gracious mother then 

Will not, to my great grief, renounce her home, 

And, following another, leave me here, 

Although my prowess even now might win 

The glorious prizes that my father won." us 

He spake and, rising, from his shoulders took 
The purple cloak, and laid the trenchant sword 
Aside ; and first he placed the rings of steel 
In order, opening for them in the ground 
A long trench by a line, and stamping close 150 

The earth around them. All admired the skill 
With which he ranged them, never having seen 
The game before. And then he took his place 
Upon the threshold, and essayed the bow ; 
And thrice he made the attempt, and thrice gave 
o'er, 155 

Yet hoping still to draw the cord, and send 
An arrow through the rings. He would have drawn 
The bow at the fourth trial, but a nod 



1 82 The Odyssey, 

Given by his father caused him to forbear, 
Though eager for the attempt. And then again *& 
The princely youth bespake the suitors thus : — 

" Well, this is strange ! I may hereafter prove 
A craven and a weakling, or perchance 
Am yet too young, and cannot trust my arm 
To do me right against the man who first 165 

Assaults me. Come then, ye whose strength excels 
My own, and try the bow, and end the strife." 

He spake, and setting down the bow to lean 
Against the firm smooth panels of the wall, 
And the swift shaft against the bow's fair curve, 170 
He took again his seat upon the throne 
From which he rose. And then Eupeithes' son, 
Antinous, to the crowd of suitors said : — 

" Rise one by one, my friends, from right to left. 
Begin where he begins who pours the wine." 17s 

So spake Antinous, and the rest approved. 
Then rose Leiodes, son of CEnops, first. 
He was their seer, and always had his seat 
Beside the ample bowl. From deeds of wrong 
He shrank with hatred, and was sore incensed *■*> 
Against the suitors all. He took the bow 
And shaft, and, going to the threshold, stood 
And tried the bow, yet bent it not ; it galled 
His hands, for they were soft, and all unused 
To such a task ; and thus at length he spake : — &$ 

" O friends, I bend it not ; another hand 
Must try. This bow, upon this very spot, 



Book XXI. 183 

Will take from many a prince the breath of life. 

And better were it thus to die, by far, 

Than, living, fail of that intent for which 190 

We haunt this place, and still from day to day 

Assemble. There is many a one whose wish 

And hope are strong to wed Penelope, 

The consort of Ulysses ; but so soon 

As he shall see and try the hero's bow 19s 

Let him with marriage presents seek to gain 

Some other bride among the long-robed dames, 

Achaia's daughters. Let him leave the queen 

To wed the suitor who shall bring to her 

The richest gifts, and him whom fate appoints." 200 

He spake, and setting down the bow to lean 
Against the firm smooth panels of the wall, 
And the swift shaft against the bow's fair curve, 
He took again bis seat upon the throne 
From which he rose. Antinoiis then took up ^s 
The word and answered, and reproached him 
thus : — 

" What words are these, Leiodes, that have passed 
Thy lips ? harsh words and fearful, — that this bow 
Shall take from many princes here the breath 
Of life, and all because thou hast no power 210 

To bend it ? Thy good mother bore thee not 
To draw the bow and send the arrow forth, 
But others of the noble suitor-train 
Are here, by whom this bow shall yet be bent." 

Then to Melanthius, keeper of the goats, «* 



184 The Odyssey. 

Antinoiis gave this bidding. " Light a fire 

With speed, Melanthius, in the palace here, 

And place a seat before it. Lay a fleece 

Upon the seat, and bring us from within 

An ample roll of fat, that we young men 220 

By warming and anointing may make soft 

The bow, and draw the cord, and end the strife." 

He spake ; Melanthius kindled instantly 
A glowing fire, and near it placed a seat, 
And on the seat a fleece, and from within 22s 

Brought forth an ample roll of fat, with which 
The young men, having warmed it, smeared the bow 
And tried, but bent it not, too weak by far 
For such a feat. Antinoiis kept aloof, 
He and the godlike youth Eurymachus, *v 

Two princes who in might excelled the rest. 

The herdsman of Ulysses meantime left 
The palace, and with him the swineherd went, 
And after them Ulysses. When they all 
Were now without the gate and palace court, 235 
Ulysses spake to them, and blandly said : — 

" Herdsman and swineherd, shall I say to you 
Somewhat, or shall I keep it back ? My heart 
Moves me to say it. Should Ulysses come, 
Led by some god, and suddenly, what aid 240 

Would he receive from you ? Would ye take part 
With him, or with the suitors ? Frankly speak ; 
And tell me what your hearts would bid you do." 

Then answered thus the keeper of the herds : 



Book XXL 185 

" O Father Jove ! wouldst thou but grant my wish, 
And let some god conduct him hither, then 246 

Shall it be seen what might is in these hands ! " 

So also did Eumaeus offer prayer 
To all the deities, that speedily 
The wise Ulysses might return ; and when 250 

The chief perceived in all its truth the thought 
And purpose of their hearts, he spake and said : — 

" Know, then, that I myself am he, at home 
Again, returning in the twentieth year, 
And after many sufferings, to the land 255 

That saw my birth. I know that I am come 
Welcome to you alone of all my train 
Of servants, since I hear no others pray 
For my return. Hear, then, what I engage 
Shall be hereafter. If some god o'ercome 260 

For me these arrogant suitors, I will give 
To each of you a wife and lands, and build 
For each a house near mine, and ye shall be 
The friends and brothers of Teiemachus 
Thenceforth. And now, that ye may surely know 
And trust me, I will show a token here, — 266 

A scar which once the white tooth of a boar 
Made, when long since, on the Parnassian mount, 
I hunted with Autolycus's sons.' 7 

Thus having said, he drew from the broad scar 27c 
The covering rags ; they looked and knew it well, 
And wept, and round Ulysses threw their arms, 
And kissed in that embrace the hero's head 



186 The Odyssey. 

And shoulders, while Ulysses also kissed 
Their heads and hands. The sun would have gone 
down 275 

Upon their weeping, but for him. He said : — 

"Cease now from tears, lest some one from the hall 
Should see us, and report of us within. 
Now let us enter, not in company, — 
I first, and ye thereafter, one by one, 
And let the sign be this : the others all — 
The haughty suitors — will refuse to me 
The bow and quiver. When thou bearest it, 
My noble friend Eumaeus, through the halls, 
Bring it and place it in my hands, and charge 285 
The women to make fast the solid doors; 
And then if any one of them should hear 
A groan or other noise of men within, 
Let her not issue forth, but silently 
Pursue her task. Meantime be it thy care, v 

My good Philcetius, with a key to lock 
The portals of the court and fix the chain." 

Thus having said, into that noble pile 
He passed again, and took the seat from which 
He lately rose, and afterward, in turn, ' =?s 

Entered the servants of the godlike chief. 

Eurymachus was busy with the bow, 
Turning and warming it before the blaze 
On both its sides. He could not bend it thus. 
There came a deep sigh from his boastful heart, 30 
And greatly was he vexed, and sadly said : — 



Book XXL 187 

" Alas ! great cause of grief indeed is here 
For me and all. 'T is not that I lament 
So much the losing of the bride, although 
That also vexes me, — there yet remain 30s 

Many fair ladies of the Achaian stock, 
Both in the sea-girt lands of Ithaca 
And other regions, — yet if we be found 
To fall in strength of arm so far below 
The great Ulysses that we cannot bend 310 

His bow, our sons will hear of it with shame." 

Eupeithes' son, Antinoiis, answered thus : 
" Not so, Eurymachus, as thou thyself 
Shouldst know. This day is held a solemn feast 
Of Phcebus by the people. Who would draw 315 
The bow to-day ? Nay, lay it by in peace, 
And suffer all the rings to stand as now ; 
For no man, as I think, will dare to come 
Into the palace of Laertes' son 
And take them hence. Let him who bears the cup 
Begin to serve the wine, that, having poured 321 

Part to the gods, we may lay down the bow, 
And with the morning let Melanthius come, — 
The goatherd, — bringing with him from the flock 
The choicest goats, that we may burn the thighs, 325 
An offering to the god of archery, 
Apollo. Then will we again essay 
The bow, and bring the contest to an end." 

So spake Antinoiis, and they all approved. 
Then heralds came, and on the suitors' hands 33* 



1 88 The Odyssey. 

Poured water ; youths filled up the cups with wine, 
Beginning at the right, and gave to each 
His share ; and when they all had poured a part, 
And each had drunk, the shrewd Ulysses thus 
With artful speech bespake the suitor-train : — 335 

" Hearken, ye suitors of the illustrious queen, 
To what ray heart is prompting me to say; 
But chiefly to Eurymachus I make 
My suit, and to Antinoiis, who so well 
Hath counselled to lay by the bow and trust 340 
The gods. To-morrow Phcebus will bestow 
The needed strength on whomsoe'er he will ; 
But let me take that polished bow, and try 
Among you, whether still the power that dwelt 
In these once pliant limbs abides in them, 34s 

Or whether happily it has passed from me 
Amid my wanderings and a life of want." 

He spake, and all were vehemently moved 
With anger, for they feared that he would bend 
The bow, and thus Antinoiis, railing, spake : — *& 

" Thou worthless vagabond, without a spark 
Of reason, art thou not content to sit 
And banquet with the proudest, where no part 
Of all the feast escapes thee, hearing all 
That we are saying, which no other man, 35s 

Stranger and beggar, is allowed to hear ! 
This good wine makes thee foolish, as wine oft 
Makes those who swallow it too greedily, 
And drink not with due stint. It maddened once 



Book XXL 189 

Eurytion, the famed Centaur, in the halls 36° 

Of the large-souled Pirithoiis. He had come 
Among the Lapithae, and when inflamed 
With wine to madness, in those very halls 
Did lawless deeds. The heroes were incensed. 
They rushed upon him, dragged him through the 
porch 36s 

And out of doors, and there cut off his nose 
And ears, and he departed, frenzied still, 
And bearing in bewilderment of mind 
His punishment, whence war arose between 
Centaurs and men ; yet surely he had brought 37° 
The evil on himself, when overcome 
With wine. Such fearful mischief I foretell 
Will light on thee, if thou shouldst bend this bow, 
Nor canst thou hope for favor here among 
The people. We will send thee speedily, 37s 

In a black galley, to King Echetus, 
The enemy of human kind, from whom 
Thou shalt find no escape. Drink, then, in peace 
Thy wine, and seek no strife with younger men." 

Then spake the sage Penelope again : 3*> 

" Truly, Antinoiis, it becomes thee not, 
Nor is it just, to vex the stranger guests 
Who seek the palace of Telemachus. 
Dost thou, then, think that, should this stranger 

bend, 
Proud as he is of his great strength of arm, 385 

The mighty bow that once Ulysses bore, 



190 The Odyssey. 

He leads me hence a bride ? No hope of that 

Is in his heart, and let no one of you 

Who banquet here allow a thought like that 

To vex him ; 't is a thing that cannot be." 39* 

Then to the queen, Eurymachus, the son 
Of Polybus, replied : " We do not fear, 
Sage daughter of Icarius, that this man 
Will lead thee hence a bride ; it cannot be. 
We fear the speech of men and women both. 395 
The very meanest of the Achaian race 
Will say : ' Degenerate men are these, who seek 
To wed the consort of a glorious chief, 
Not one of whom can draw the bow he bore ; 
And now there comes a wandering beggar-man, 400 
Who draws the bow with ease, and sends a shaft 
Through all the rings of steel.' Thus will they speak, 
And this will be to us a cause of shame ! " 

And then the sage Penelope rejoined : 
" Eurymachus, it cannot be that those 405 

Should earn the general praise who make the wealth 
Of a most worthy man their spoil, and bring 
Dishonor on his house. The stranger's frame 
Is powerful and well knit ; he claims to be 
Of noble parentage. Now let him take 410 

The bow, and we will see the event ; but this 
1 promise, and will make my promise good, 
If he should bend it, — if Apollo give 
To him that glory, — he shall have from me 
A tunic and a cloak, fair garments both, 415 



Book XXL 191 

And a keen javelin, his defence against 
Both dogs and men, a two-edged sword besides, 
And sandals for his feet, and I engage 
To send him whither he desires to go.'' 

Then spake discreet Telemachus again : ** 

" Mother, in all Achaia there is none 
Who has more power than I can claim, to grant 
Or to deny the bow to whom I will. 
No one of those who rule the rugged coast 
Of Ithaca, or isles where Elis breeds 425 

Her mares, may interpose to thwart my will, 
If on the stranger I bestow the bow 
To be his own, and bid him take it hence. 
Withdraw, O queen, into thy bower ; direct 
Thy household tasks, the distaff and the web, 430 
And bid thy maidens speed the work. The bow 
Belongs to men, and most to me ; for here, 
Within these walls, the authority is mine." 

The queen, astonished, heard him and withdrew, 
But kept her son's wise sayings in her heart 43s 

And then ascending to her bower, among 
Her maids, she wept her well-beloved lord, 
Ulysses, till the blue-eyed Pallas came, 
And poured upon her lids the balm of sleep. 

Meantime the worthy swineherd bore the bow 440 
In hand, and all along the palace-halls 
The suitor-crew were chiding him aloud, 
And thus an insolent youth among them spake : — 

" Thou Rwkward swineherd, whither goest thou 



192 The Odyssey. 

With the curved bow ? Thy own fleet dogs which 
thou 445 

Hast reared shall soon devour thee, far from men 
And midst thy herds of swine, if we find grace 
With Phcebus and the other deathless gods." 

Such were their words ; the swineherd where he 
stood 
Set down the bow in fear, for many a voice 450 

Called to him in the hall. On the other side 
Shouted Telemachus with threatening words : — 

" Nay, father, carry on the bow, nor think 
To stop at every man's command ; lest I, 
Though younger than thyself, cast stones at thee, 45s 
And chase thee to the fields, for I in strength 
Excel thee. Would that I excelled as far 
In strength of arm the suitors in these halls, 
Then would I roughly through the palace-gates 
Drive many who are plotting mischief now." 46c 

He spake, and all with hearty laughter heard 
His words, and for their sake allowed their wrath 
Against the prince to cool. The swineherd went 
Forward, along the hall, and, drawing near 
The wise Ulysses, gave into his hands 465 

The bow ; and then he called the nurse aside, 
Dame Eurycleia, and bespake her thus : — 

" Sage Eurycleia, from Telemachus 
I charge thee to make fast the solid doors, 
And then, if any of the maids should hear 4r 

A groan or other noise of men within, 



Book XXL 193 

Let her not issue forth, but silently 

Pursue the task in hand, and keep her place." 

He spake, nor were his words in vain. The dame 
Made fast the doors of that magnificent hall, 475 
While silently Philcetius hastened forth 
And locked the portals of the high-walled court. 
A cable of the bark of Byblos lay 
Beneath the portico, — it once had served 
A galley, — and with this the herdsman tied 480 
The portals, and, returning, took the seat 
Whence he had risen, but ever kept his eye 
Fixed on his lord. Ulysses, meantime, held 
The bow, and, turning it, intently eyed 
Side after side, and tried each part in turn, 485 

For fear that worms, while he was far away, 
Had pierced the horn. At this, a youth among 
The suitors, turning to his neighbor, said : — 

" Lo an inspector and a judge of bows ! 
Perhaps he has a bow like that at home, 49" 

Or else would make one like it. How he shifts 
The thing with busy hands from side to side, — 
The vagabond, well trained in knavish tricks ! "■ 

Then also said another insolent youth : 
" May he in all things be as fortunate 495 

As now, when he shall try to bend that bow!" 

Such was their talk ; but when the wary chief 
Jiad poised and shrewdly scanned the mighty bow, 
Then, as a singer, skilled to play the harp, 
Stretches with ease on its new fastenings s» 

VOL. II. 9 M 



194 The Odyssey. 

A string, the twisted entrails of a sheep, 

Made fast at either end, so easily 

Ulysses bent that mighty bow. He took 

And drew the cord with his right hand ; it twanged 

With a clear sound as when a swallow screams. 505 

The suitors were dismayed, and all grew pale. 

Jove in loud thunder gave a sign from heaven. 

The much-enduring chief, Ulysses, heard 

With joy the friendly omen, which the son 

Of crafty Saturn sent him. He took up s«> 

A winged arrow, that before him lay 

Upon a table, drawn ; the others still 

Were in the quiver's womb ; the Greeks were yet 

To feel them. This he set with care against 

The middle of the bow, and toward him drew 515 

The cord and arrow-notch, just where he sat, 

And, aiming opposite, let fly the shaft. 

He missed no ring of all ; from first to last 

The brass-tipped arrow threaded every one. 

Then to Telemachus Ulysses said : — 5=0 

" Telemachus, the stranger sitting here 
Hath not disgraced thee. I have neither missed 
The rings, nor found it hard to bend the bow ; 
Nor has my manly strength decayed, as these 
Who seek to bring me to contempt pretend ; 523 
And now the hour is come when we prepare 
A supper for the Achaians, while the day 
Yet lasts, and after supper the delights 
Of song and harp, which nobly grace a feast."
Book XXII. 195 

He spake, and nodded to Telemachus, 530 

His well-beloved son, who girded on 
His trenchant sword, and took in hand his spear, 
And, armed with glittering brass for battle, came 
And took his station by his father's seat.
