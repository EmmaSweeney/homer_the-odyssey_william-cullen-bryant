NOW was the godlike chief Ulysses left 
In his own palace, planning, with the aid 
Of Pallas, to destroy the suitor-train, 
And thus bespake his son with winged words : — 

" Now is the time, Telemachus, to take 
The weapons thac are here, and store them up 
In the inner rooms. Then, if the suitors ask 
The reason, answer them with specious words : 
Say, ' I have put them where there comes no smoke. 
Since even now they do not seem the arms 10 

Left by Ulysses when he sailed for Troy, 
So tarnished are they by the breath of fire j 
And yet another reason sways my mind, 
The prompting of some god, that ye, when flushed 
With wine and in the heat of a dispute, *s 

May smite and wound each other, and disgrace 
The banquet and your wooing ; for the sight 



134 The Odyssey. 

Of steel doth draw men on to violence.' " 

He ended, and Telemachus obeyed 
His father's words, and calling forth his nurse, =• 
The aged Eurycleia, said to her : — 

" Go, nurse, and see the women all shut up 
In their own place, while in our inner room 
I lay away my father's beautiful arms, 
Neglected long, and sullied by the smoke, ^ 

While he was absent. I was then a child, 
But now would keep them from the breath of fire." 

And thus the nurse, Dame Eurycleia, said : 
" Would that at length, my child, thou didst exert 
Thy proper wisdom here, and take in charge 30 

Thy house and thy possessions. But who goes 
With thee to bear a torch, since none of these, 
Thy handmaids, are allowed to light thy way ? " 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 
" This stranger. No man may be idle here 35 

Who eats my bread, though from a distant land." 

He spake, nor flew his words in vain. The nurse 
Closed all the portals of that noble pile. 
Ulysses and his glorious son in haste 
Bore off the helmets, and the bossy shields, <o 

And the sharp spears, while Pallas held to them 
A golden lamp, that shed a fair clear light. 
Then to his father spake Telemachus : — 

" Father ! my eyes behold a marvel. All 
The palace walls, each beautiful recess, as 

The fir-tree beams, the aspiring columns, shine, 



Book XIX. 135 

Before my eyes, as with a blaze of fire. 

Some god is surely here, some one of those 

Who make their dwelling in the high broad heaven." 

! Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 50 

" Keep silence ; give thy thought no speech, nor ask 

Concerning aught. Such is the wont of those 

Who dwell upon Olympus. Now withdraw 

To rest upon thy couch, while I remain, 

For I would move thy mother and her maids 55 

To ask of what concerns me. She, I deem, 

Full sadly will inquire of many things." 

He spake ; Telemachus departed thence, 
By torchlight, to his chamber, there to rest 
Where he was wont to lie when gentle sleep & 

Came over him. There lay he down to wait 
The hallowed morning, while Ulysses, left 
Within the palace, meditated still 
Death to the suitors with Minerva's aid. 

The sage Penelope now left her bower ; 65 

Like Dian or like golden Venus came 
The queen. Beside the hearth they placed for her 
The throne where she was wont to sit, inlaid 
With ivory and silver, which of yore 
The artisan Icmalius wrought. They laid 7° 

Close to the throne a footstool, over which 
Was spread an ample fleece. On this sat down 
The sage Penelope. Her white-armed train 
Of handmaids came with her; they cleared away 
The abundant feast, and bore the tables off, 75 



136 The Odyssey. 

And cups from which those insolent men had drunk ; 
They laid upon the ground the lighted brands, 
And heaped fresh fuel round them, both for light 
And warmth. And now Melantho once again 
Bespake Ulysses with unmannerly words : — &• 

" Stranger, wilt thou forever be a pest, 
Ranging the house at night to play the spy 
Upon the women ? Leave the hall, thou wretch ! 
And gorge thyself without, else wilt thou go 
Suddenly, driven by blows and flaming brands." s s 

The sage Ulysses frowned on her, and said : 
" Pert creature ! why so fiercely rail at me ? 
Is it that I am squalid and ill-clad, 
And forced by want to beg from hand to hand ? 
Such is the fate of poor and wandering men. 90 

I too was opulent once, inhabiting 
A plenteous home among my fellow-men, 
And often gave the wanderer alms, whoe'er 
He might be and in whatsoever need ; 
And I had many servants, and large store 9s 

Of things by which men lead a life of ease 
And are called rich. But Jupiter, the son 
Of Saturn, put an end to this, for so 
It pleased the god. Now, therefore, woman, think 
That thou mayst lose the beauty which is now «» 
Thy pride among the serving-women here ; 
Thy mistress may be wroth, and make thy life 
A hard one ; or Ulysses may come back, — 
And there is hope of that. Or if it be 



Book XIX. 137 

That he has perished, and returns no more, 10s 

There still remains his son Telemachus, 

Who by Apollo's grace is now a man, 

And no one of the women in these halls 

May think to misbehave, and yet escape 

His eye, for he no longer is a boy." 210 

He spake ; Penelope, the prudent, heard, 
And, calling to her maid, rebuked her thus : — 

" O bold and shameless ! I have taken note 
Of thy behavior ; thou hast done a wrong 
For which thy head should answer. Well thou 
know'st, ns 

For thou hast heard me say, that I would ask 
The stranger in these halls if aught he knows 
Of my Ulysses, for whose sake I grieve." 

Then to the matron of the household turned 
The queen, and thus bespake Eurynome : — i» 

" Bring now a seat, Eurynome, and spread 
A fleece upon it, where the stranger guest 
May sit at ease, and hear what I shall say, 
And answer me, for I have much to ask." 

She spake ; the ancient handmaid brought with 
speed 125 

A polished seat, and o'er it spread a fleece. 
Ulysses, much-enduring chief, sat down, 
And thus the sage Penelope began : — - 

" First will I ask thee who thou art, and whence, 
Where is thy birthplace, and thy parents who ? " w 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 



138 The Odyssey. 

" O lad)', none in all the boundless earth 
Can speak of thee with blame. Thy fame has reached 
To the great heavens. It is like the renown 
Of some most excellent king, of godlike sway 13s 
O'er many men and mighty, who upholds 
Justice in all his realm. The dark-soiled earth 
Brings wheat and barley forth ; the trees are bowed 
With fruit ; the meadows swarm with noble herds, 
The sea with fish, and under his wise reign 140 

The people prosper. Therefore ask, I pray, 
Of other things, while I am underneath 
Thy palace-roof, but of my race and home 
Inquire not, lest thou waken in my mind 
Unhappy memories. I am a man nt 

Of sorrow, and it would become me ill 
To sit lamenting in another's house 
And shedding tears. Besides, a grief indulged 
Doth grow in violence. Thy maids would blame, 
And thou perhaps, and ye would call my tears 150 
The maudlin tears of one o'ercome with wine." 

Then spake the sage Penelope again : 
" Stranger, such grace of feature and of form 
As once I had the immortals took away, 
What time the Argive warriors sailed for Troy, m 
And my Ulysses with them. Could he now 
Return to rule my household as of yore, 
The wider and the brighter w 7 ere my fame. 
But now I lead a wretched life, so great 
And many are the evils which some god x* 



Book XTX. 139 

Heaps on me. For the chieftains who bear sway 

Over the isles — Dulichium, and the fields 

Of Samos, and Zacynthus dark with woods, 

And those who rule in sunny Ithaca — 

Woo me against my will, and waste away 163 

My substance. Therefore have I small regard 

For strangers and for suppliants, and the tribe 

Of heralds, servants of the public weal, 

But, pining for Ulysses, wear away 

My life. The suitors urge the marriage rite, 170 

And I with art delay it. Once some god 

Prompted me to begin an ample web, 

Wide and of subtle texture, in my rooms. 

And then I said : ' Youths, who are pressing me 

To marriage, since Ulysses is no more, 175 

Urge me no further till I shall complete — 

That so the threads may not be spun in vain — 

This shroud for old Laertes, when grim fate 

And death's long sleep at last shall overtake 

The hero ; else among the multitude **> 

Of Grecian women I shall bear the blame, 

If one whose ample wealth so well was known 

Should lie in death without a funeral robe.' 

I spake, and easily their minds were swayed 

By what I said, and I began to weave 185 

The ample web, but ravelled it again 

By torchlight every evening. For three years 

I foiled them thus ; but when the fourth year came, 

And brought its train of hours and changing moons, 



140 The Odyssey. 

.And many days had passed, they came on me, is* 

And through my maidens' fault, a careless crew, 

They caught me at my fraud, and chid me sore. 

So, though unwilling, I was forced to end 

My task, and cannot longer now escape 

The marriage, nor is any refuge left. 19s 

My parents both exhort me earnestly 

To choose a husband, and my son with grief 

Beholds the suitors wasting his estate, 

And he already is a man and well 

Can rule his household ; Jupiter bestows so. 

Such honor on him. Now, I pray, declare 

Thy lineage, for thou surely art not sprung 

From the old fabulous oak, nor from a rock." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her : 
" O royal consort of Laertes' son ! sos 

Wilt thou still ask my lineage ? I will then 
Disclose it, but thou wakest in my heart 
New sorrows. So it ever is with one 
Who long, like me, is far away from home, 
Wandering in many realms, and suffering much; m6 
But since thou dost require it, thou shalt hear. 

" Crete is a region lying in the midst 
Of the black deep, a fair and fruitful land, 
Girt by the waters. Many are the men, 
Nay, numberless, who make it their abode, 215 

And ninety are its cities. Different tongues 
Are spoken by the dwellers of the isle. 
In part they are Achaians, and in part 



Book XIX. 141 

Are Cretans of the soil, a gallant stock ; 

There dwell Cydonians, Dorians of three tribes, »» 

And proud Pelasgians. Their great capital 

Is Cnossus, where the monarch Minos dwelt, 

He who at every nine years' end conferred 

With Jove almighty ; and to him was born 

Deucalion, my brave father, who begat »s 

Me and Idomeneus, the King of Crete. 

To Ilium in his beaked galleys sailed 

Idomeneus with Atreus' sons. My name — 

A name well known — is ^Ethon. 'T was at Crete 

I saw Ulysses, who received from me 230 

The welcome due a guest. A violent wind 

Had driven him from Maleia and the course 

That led to Ilium, and had carried him 

To Crete, and lodged him in the dangerous port 

Amnisus, close to Ilithyia's cave, 23s 

Where scarce his fleet escaped the hurricane. 

Thence came he to the city, and inquired 

For King Idomeneus, who was, he said, 

His dear and honored guest ; but he had sailed 

Ten days before, perhaps eleven, for Troy, w 

In his beaked galleys. To the palace there 

[ led Ulysses, and with liberal cheer 

Welcomed the chief, for plentifully stored 

The royal dwelling was. I also gave 

Meal from the public magazines to him 245 

And those who followed him, and dark red wine 

Brought from the country round, and beeves to slay 



142 The Odyssey. 

In sacrifice, that so their hearts might feel 

No lack of aught. Twelve days the noble Greeks 

Remained with us. A violent north-wind, «s« 

Which scarcely suffered them to stand upright 

On shore, withstood them. Some unfriendly power 

Had bid it blow ; but on the thirteenth day 

Its fury ceased, and the fleet put to sea." 

Thus went he on, inventing tales that seemed 25s 
Like truth. She listened, melting into tears 
That flowed as when on mountain height the snow, 
Shed by the west-wind, feels the east-wind's breath, 
And flows in water, and the hurrying streams 
Are filled ; so did Penelope's fair cheeks 260 

Seem to dissolve in tears, — tears shed for him 
Who sat beside her even then. He saw 
His weeping wife, and pitied her at heart ; 
Yet were his eyes like iron or like horn, 
And moved not in their lids ; for artfully 26s 

He kept his tears from falling. When the queen 
Had ceased to weep, she answered him and said : — 

" Now, stranger, let me prove thee, if in truth 
Thou didst receive, as thou hast just declared, 
In thine abode, my husband and his train =7° 

Of noble friends. Describe the garb he wore ; 
How looked he, and the friends he brought with 
him ? " 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her: 
u O lady, hard it is to answer thee, 
So long have I been far away from home. i< 



Book XIX. 143 

T is now the twentieth year since he was there 
And left the isle, but, as my memory bids, 
So will I speak. A fleecy purple cloak 
Ulysses wore, a double web ; the clasp 
Was golden, with two fastenings, and in front aeo 
It showed a work of rare design, — a hound 
That held in his fore-paws a spotted fawn, 
Struggling before his open mouth. Although 
The figures were of gold, we all admired 
The hound intent to break his victim's neck, 28s 
The fawn that, writhing, plied her nimble feet 
To free herself. Around the hero's chest 
And waist I saw a lustrous tunic worn, 
Soft, like the thin film of the onion dried, 
And bright as sunshine ; many ladies looked 290 
With wonder on it. Yet consider this ; 
I know not whether thus attired he left 
His home, or whether, in the voyage thence, 
Some comrade gave the garments, or perhaps 
Some friendly host, for he was very dear 29s 

To many ; among the Greeks were few like him. 
I gave him, from myself, a brazen sword, 
And a fair purple cloak, a double web, 
Besides a tunic reaching to his feet, 
And with due honors sent him on his way -wo 

In his good ship- There came and went with him 
A herald somewhat older than himself; 
Let me portray him, ■*- hunchbacked, swarthy 
skinned, 



144 Tke Odyssey. 

And curly haired, Eurybates his name. 

Ulysses honored him above the rest 303 

Of his companions, for they thought alike." 

He ceased ; the queen was moved to deeper grief, 
For she remembered all the tokens well 
Of which he spake ; and when that passionate gust 
Of weeping ceased, she spake again and said : — 3 m 

" Stranger, till now thy presence in these halls 
Has only moved my pity ; thou henceforth 
Art dear and honored. It was I who gave 
The garments thou hast told me of; these hands 
Folded them in my chamber. I put on 3 *s 

The glittering clasp to be his ornament, 
And now I never shall behold him more 
Returning to his own dear land and home ; 
So cruel was the fate that took him hence 
To Ilium, in his roomy ship, a town 320 

Of evil omen never to be named." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" O gracious consort of Laertes' son ! 
Let not thy grief for him whom thou hast lost 
Wither thy beauty longer, and consume 32s 

Thy heart. And yet I blame thee not at all ; 
For any wife in losing him to whom 
She gave herself while yet a maid, and bore 
Children, will mourn him, though he be in worth 
Below Ulysses, who, as fame declares, 33c 

Is like the gods. But cease to grieve, and hear 
What I shall say, and I shall speak the truth, 



Book XIX. 145 

Nor will I hide from thee that I have heard, 

But lately from Ulysses, yet alive, 

And journeying homeward, in the opulent realm 33s 

Of the Thesprotians, whence he brings with him 

Much and rare treasure, gathered there among 

The people. His beloved friends he lost, 

And his good ship ,■ the black deep swallowed them 

In coming from Trinacria, for his crew 34 ° 

Had slaughtered there the oxen of the Sun. 

The Sun and Jove were angry ; therefore all 

His comrades perished in the billowy sea ; 

But him upon his galley's keel the wind 

Drove to the coast where the Phaeacians dwell, 345 

The kinsmen of the gods. They welcomed him, 

And honored him as if he were a god, 

And gave him many things, and would have sent 

The hero safely to his native isle; 

And here Ulysses would have been long since, 350 

But that he deemed it wise to travel far, 

And gather wealth, — for well UJysses knew, 

Beyond all other men, the arts of gain, 

And none in these could think to rival him ; 

So Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians said, 355 

Who also, in his palace, swore to me — 

As to the gods of heaven he poured the wine — ■ 

That even then a galley was drawn down 

Into the water, and already manned 

With rowers, who should take Ulysses home. 360 

But me he first dismissed, for at the time 

VOL. II. 7 ! 



146 The Odyssey. 

A bark of the Thesprotians left the port, 

Bound for Dulichium's cornfields. Ere I went 

He showed the treasures of Ulysses stored 

In the king's palace, — treasures that might serve 36s 

To feed the household of another chief 

To the tenth generation. He who owned 

That wealth was at Dodona, so the king 

Declared, inquiring, at the lofty oak 

Of Jupiter, the counsel of the god 37* 

How to return to his dear native land, 

So long a wanderer, — whether openly 

Or else by stealth. So he is safe, and soon 

Will he be nearer to us ; for not long 

Can he remain away from all his friends 37s 

And fatherland. To this I plight my oath ; 

Let Jove, the greatest and the best of gods, 

Be witness, and this hearth of the good prince 

Ulysses, where I sit, that every word 

Which I have said to thee will be fulfilled. 380 

Within the year Ulysses will return, 

As this month passes and the next comes in." 

Then spake the sage Penelope again : 
" Would that it might be thus, O stranger guest, 
As thou hast said ; then shouldst thou have such 
thanks 38s 

And bounty at my hands that every one 
Who meets thee should rejoice with thee. And yr" 
The thought abides with me, and so indeed 
It must be, that Ulysses will no more 



Book XIX. 147^ 

Return, nor wilt thou find an escort hence ; 390 

For now no master like Ulysses rules — 

And what a man was he ! — within these walls, 

To welcome or dismiss the honored guest. 

But now, ye maidens, let the stranger bathe, 

And spread his couch with blankets, fleecy cloaks, 

And showy tapestries, that he may lie 396 

Warm till the Morning, in her golden car, 

Draw near ; then with the early morn again 

Bathe and anoint him, that he may sit down 

Beside Telemachus prepared to take 400 

His morning meal. Ill shall he fare who dares 

Molest the stranger ; he shall have no place 

Or office here, however he may rage. 

And how, O stranger, wouldst thou learn that I 

In mind and thoughtful wisdom am above 405 

All other women, if I let thee sit 

Squalid and meanly clad at banquets here ? 

Short is the life of man, and whoso bears 

A cruel heart, devising cruel things, 

On him men call down evil from the gods 4» 

While living, and pursue him, when he dies, 

With scorTs. But whoso is of generous heart 

And harbors generous aims, his guests proclaim 

His praises far and wide to all mankind, 

And numberless are they who call him good." 415 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" O gracious consort of Laertes' son ! 
Such cloaks and splendid coverings please me not, 



148 The Odyssey. 

Since in my long-oared bark I left behind 

The snowy peaks of Crete. I still will lie, ** 

As I am wont through many a sleepless night, 

On a mean couch to wait the holy Morn 

Upon her car of gold. I do not like 

This washing of the feet. No maiden here 

That ministers to thee may touch my foot ; 425 

But if among them be some aged dame 

And faithful, who has suffered in her life 

As I have suffered, she may touch my feet." 

And thus the sage Penelope rejoined : 
" Dear guest, — for never to these halls has come 430 
A stranger so discreet or better liked 
By me, so wisely thou dost speak, and well, — 
I have an aged prudent dame, whose care 
Reared my unfortunate husband. She received 
The nursling when his mother brought him forth, 435 
And she, though small her strength, will wash thy 

feet. 
Rise, prudent Eurycleia, thou shalt wash 
The feet of one whose years must be the same 
As thy own master's ; such is doubtless now 
Ulysses, with such wrinkled feet and hands. 440 

For quickly doth misfortune make men old/' 

She spake ; the aged handmaid hid her face 
With both her hands, and, shedding bitter tears, 
Thus sorrowfully to the queen replied : — 

" My heart is sad for thee, my son ; and yet 44s 
I can do nothing. Can it be that Jove 



Book XIX. 149 

Hates thee beyond all other ? though thyself 

So reverent to the gods ? No man on earth 

Has burned so many thighs of fatling beasts 

And chosen hecatombs as thou to Jove 45* 

The Thunderer, with prayer that thou mayst reach 

A calm old age, and rear thy glorious son 

To manhood; yet the god hath cut thee off 

From thy return forever. Even now 

Perchance the women of some princely house 4ss 

Which he has entered in some distant land 

Scoff at him as these wretched creatures scoff 

At thee, O stranger, who, to shun their taunts 

And insults, wilt not suffer them to wash 

Thy feet. The sage Penelope commands, 4&> 

And I am not unwilling. I will wash 

Thy feet, both for her sake and for thy own ; 

For deeply am I moved at sight of thee. 

Hear what I say : of strangers in distress 

Come many hither, yet have I beheld 465 

No one who bears, in shape and voice and feet, 

Such likeness to our absent lord as thou." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, thus replied : 
" O aged woman, so has it been said 
By all who have beheld both him and me. 470 

They all declare that we are very like 
Each other \ thou in this hast spoken well." 

He spake ; she took a shining vase designed 
For washing feet, and poured cold water in 
In large abundance, and warm water next. 47s 



150 The Odyssey. 

Ulysses, who had sat before the hearth, 

Moved to a darker spot, for in his mind 

The thought arose that she might find a scar 

Upon his limbs in handling them, and thus 479 

His secret would be known. She came and bathed 

His feet, and found the scar. *T was where a boar 

With his white tooth had gashed the limb, as once 

He journeyed to Parnassus, where he paid 

A visit to Autolycus and his sons, 

His mother's noble father, who excelled *s s 

All men in craft and oaths, such was the gift 

Conferred on him by Hermes ; for to him 

Autolycus made grateful offerings, 

The thighs of lambs and kids, and evermore 

The god was with him. Once Autolycus 4* 

Came to the opulent realm of Ithaca, 

And found his daughter with a son new born ; 

There Eurycleia placed upon his knees 

The infant, just as he had supped, and said : — 

" Give this dear babe, Autolycus, a name, — 49s 
Thy daughter's son, vouchsafed to many prayers.'* 

And thus Autolycus in answer spake : 
" Daughter and son-in-law, be his the name 
That I shall give. In coming to his isle 
I bear the hate of many — both of men s°o 

And women — scattered o'er the nourishing earth; 
Name him Ulysses therefore, and when, grown 
To man's estate, he visits the proud halls 
Reared at Parnassus, where his mother dwelt 



Book XIX. 151 

And my possessions lie, I will bestow s°s 

A share on him, and send him home rejoiced." 

And therefore went Ulysses to receive 
The promised princely gifts. Autolycus 
And all his sons received him with kind words, 
And friendly grasp of hands. Amphithea there — s» 
His mother's mother — took him in her arms, 
And kissed his brow and both his beautiful eyes. 
Then to his noble sons Autolycus 
Called to prepare a feast, and they obeyed. 
They brought and slew a steer of five years old, 515 
And flayed and dressed it, hewed the joints apart, 
And sliced the flesh, and fixed it upon spits, 
Roasted it carefully, and gave to each 
His part. So all the day till set of sun 
They feasted, to the full content of all. $* 

And when the sun had set, and earth grew dark, 
They laid them down, and took the gift of sleep. 
But when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared, 
Born of the Dawn, forth issued the young men, 
The children of Autolycus, with hounds, s» 

To hunt, attended by their noble guest, 
Ulysses. Up the steeps of that high mount 
Parnassus, clothed with woods, they climbed, and 

soon 
Were on its airy heights. The sun, new risen 
From the deep ocean's gently flowing stream, 530 
Now smote the fields. The hunters reached a dell 3 
The hounds before them tracked the game ; behind 



152 The Odyssey. 

Followed the children of Autolycus. 
The generous youth Ulysses, brandishing 
A spear of mighty length, came pressing on 535 

Close to the hounds. There lay a huge wild boar 
Within a thicket, where moist-blowing winds 
Came not, nor in his brightness could the sun 
Pierce with his beams the covert, nor the rain 
Pelt through, so closely grew the shrubs. The 

ground 540 

Was heaped with sheddings of the withered leaves. 
Around him came the noise of dogs and men 
Approaching swiftly. From his lair he sprang 
And faced them, with the bristles on his neck 
Upright, and flashing eyes. Ulysses rushed s*s 
Before the others, with the ponderous spear 
Raised high in his strong hand intent to smite. 
The boar was first to strike ; he dealt a blow 
Sidelong, and gashed his foe above the knee, 
And tore the flesh, but left untouched the bone. 550 
Ulysses, striking with his burnished spear 
The boar's right shoulder, drove the weapon through. 
He fell with piercing cries amid the dust, 
And the life left him. Then around their guest 
The kindly children of Autolycus 555 

Came and bound up with care the wound, and 

stanched 
With spells the dark blood of the blameless youth, 
And hastened with him to their father's home. 
And when Autolycus and they his sons

Had seen him wholly healed, they loaded him & 

With presents, and, rejoicing for his sake, 

Sent him rejoicing back to Ithaca. 

His father and his gracious mother there 

Rejoiced in turn, and asked him of the scar, 

And how it came, and he related all, — &s 

How by the white tusk of a savage boar 

The wound was given on the Parnassian heights, 

As he was hunting with her father's sons. 

The aged woman, as she took the foot 
Into her hands, perceived by touch the scar, 570 
And, letting fall the limb, it struck the vase. 
Loud rang the brass, the vase was overturned, 
And poured the water forth. At once a rush 
Of gladness and of grief came o'er her heart. 
Tears filled her eyes, and her clear voice was 
choked. 575 

She touched Ulysses on the chin, and said : — 

" Dear child ! thou art Ulysses, of a truth. 
I knew thee not till I had touched the scar." 

So speaking, toward Penelope she turned 
Her eyes, about to tell her that her lord 530 

Was in the palace ; but the queen saw not, 
And all that passed was unperceived by her, 
For Pallas turned her thoughts another way. 
Meantime, Ulysses on the nurse's throat 
Laid his right hand, and with the other drew 585 
The aged woman nearer him, and said : — 

" Nurse, wouldst thou ruin me, who drew long since 
7* 



154 The Odyssey. 

Milk from thy bosom, and who now return, 

After much suffering borne for twenty years, 

To mine own land ? Now then, since thou hast 

learned 599 

The truth, — by prompting of some god, no doubt, — 
Keep silence, lest some others in the house 
Should learn it also. Else, — I tell thee this, 
And will perform my word, — if God permit 
That I o'ercome the arrogant suitor-crew, 595 

Nurse as thou art, I spare not even thee, 
When in these halls the other maidens die." 

Then thus the prudent Eurycleia said : 
" What words, my son, have passed thy lips ? for 

well 
Thou knowest my firm mind ; it never yields. &» 
Like solid rock or steel I keep my trust. 
This let me tell thee, and, I pray thee, keep 
My words in mind. If, by the aid of God, 
Thou overcome the arrogant suitor-crew, 
Then will I name the handmaids that disgrace 60s 
Thy household, and point out the innocent." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, thus rejoined : 
u . Why name them, nurse ? It needs not. I myself 
Shall watch them, and shall know them all. Hold 

thou 
Thy peace, and leave the issue with the gods." «« 

He spake ; the aged woman left the place 
To bring a second bath, for on the floor 
The first was spilled. When she had bathed his feet 



Book XIX. 155 

And made them smooth with oil, Ulysses drew 
Close to the hearth his seat again, to take 6x5 

The warmth, and with his tatters hid the scar. 
And thus the sage Penelope began : — 
" Stranger, but little longer will I yet 
Inquire ; the hour of grateful rest is near 
For those who, though unhappy, can receive e» 
The balm of slumber. Yet for me some god 
Appoints immeasurable grief. All day 
In sorrows and in sighs, my solace is 
To oversee my maidens at their tasks 
Here in the palace ; but when evening comes, e 25 
And all betake themselves to rest, I lie 
Upon my couch, and sorrows thick and sharp 
Awake new misery in my heart. As when, 
In the fresh spring, the swarthy Nightingale, 
Daughter of Pandarus, among thick leaves 63" 

Sings sweetly to the woods, and, changing oft 
The strain, pours forth her voice of many notes, 
Lamenting the beloved Itylus, 
Her son by royal Zethos, whom she smote 
Unwittingly, and slew ; with such quick change 6 3S 
My mind is tossed from thought to thought. I muse 
Whether to keep my place beside my son, 
And hold what here is mine, my dower, my maids 
And high-roofed halls, as one who still reveres 
Her husband's bed, and heeds the public voice, 640 
Or follow one of the Achaian chiefs, 
The noblest of the wooers, and the one 



156 The Odyssey. 

Who offers marriage presents without stint. 
My son's green years, while he was yet a boy, 
Unripe in mind, allowed me not to wed, 645 

And leave his father's home ; but he is grown, 
And on the verge of manhood. He desires 
That I should leave the palace, for his wrath 
Is great against the men who waste his wealth. 
Hear, and interpret now a dream of mine : 650 

Within these courts are twenty geese that eat 
Corn from the water, and I look on them 
Pleased and amused. From off a mountain came 
A hook-beaked eagle, broke their necks, and left 
Their bodies strewn about the palace dead, 6 53 

And soared again into the air of heaven. 
I wept and moaned, although it was a dream ; 
And round me came the fair-haired Grecian maids, 
Lamenting wildly that the bird of prey 
Had slain my geese. Then came the eagle back, 660 
And took his perch upon the jutting roof, 
And thus bespake me in a human voice : — 

" * O daughter cf Icarius, the renowned ! 
Let not thy heart be troubled ; this is not 
A dream, but a true vision, and will be 66s 

Fulfilled. The geese denote the suitor-train, 
And I, who was an eagle once, am come, 
Thy husband, now to end them utterly.' 

" He spake ; my slumbers left me, and I looked, 
And saw the geese that in the palace still *v> 

Were at their trough, and feeding as before." 



Book XIX. 157 

And thus Ulysses, the sagacious, said : 
" Lady, the dream that visited thy sleep 
Cannot be wrested to another sense. 
Ulysses has himself revealed to thee 675 

The way of its fulfilment. Death is near 
The suitors, and not one escapes his doom." 

Then spake the sage Penelope again : 
" Of dreams, O stranger, some are meaningless 
And idle, and can never be fulfilled. 680 

Two portals are there for their shadowy shapes, 
Of ivory one, and one of horn. The dreams 
That come through the carved ivory deceive 
With promises that never are made good ; 
But those which pass the doors of polished horn, 685 
And are beheld of men, are ever true. 
And yet I cannot hope that my strange dream 
Came through them, though my son and I would both 
Rejoice if it were so. This let me say, 
And heed me well. To-morrow brings to us 690 
The hateful morn which takes me from my home, 
The palace of Ulysses. I shall now 
Propose a contest. In the palace court 
Ulysses in a row set up twelve stakes, 
Like props that hold a galley up ; each stake 695 
Had its own ring ; he stood afar, and sent 
An arrow through them all. I shall propose 
This contest to the suitors. He who bends 
The bow with easy mastery, and sends 
Through the twelve rings an arrow, I will take 700 



158 The Odyssey. 

To follow from the palace where I passed 
My youthful married life, — a beautiful home, 
And stored with wealth ; a home which I shall long 
Remember, even in my nightly dreams." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 70s 

" O gracious consort of Laertes' son ! 
Let not this contest be delayed ; the man 
Of ready wiles, Ulysses, will be here 
Ere, tampering with the hero's polished bow, 
The suitors shall prevail to stretch the cord, 710 

And send an arrow through the rings of steel." 

And thus the sage Penelope rejoined : 
" Stranger, if, sitting in the palace here, 
Thou still wouldst entertain me as thou dost, 
Sleep would not fall upon my lids ; and yet 71s 

Sleepless the race of mortals cannot be, 
So have the gods ordained, who measure out 
His lot to man upon the nourishing earth. 
I to the upper rooms withdraw, to take 
My place upon the couch which has become 720 

To me a place of sorrow and of tears 
Since my Ulysses went away to Troy, 
That fatal town which should be named no more. 
And I will lay me down ; but thou remain 
Within these walls, and make the floor thy bed, 72s 
Or let these maidens spread a couch for thee." 

Penelope, thus having spoken, went 
Up to her royal bower, but not alone ; 
Her maids went with her. When they were within 



Book XX. 159 

rihe wept for her dear husband, till at length 730 
The blue-eyed Pallas graciously distilled 
Upon her closing lids the balm of sleep.
