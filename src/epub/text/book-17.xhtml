NOW when the rosy-fingered Morn looked 
forth,— 
The daughter of the Dawn, — Telemachus, 
The dear son of the great Ulysses, bound 
The shapely sandals underneath his feet, 
And took the massive spear that fitted well 5 

His grasp, and, as he stood in act to go 
Up to the town, bespake the swineherd thus : — 

" Father, I hasten to the town, that there 
My mother may behold me ; for I think 
She will not cease to grieve, and fear, and weep, » 



Book XVII. 89 

Till her eyes rest on me. I leave with thee 

The charge of leading our unfortunate guest 

Into the city, there to beg his bread. 

Whoever will may give him food and drink. 

All men I cannot feed, and I have cares 15 

Enough already. If he chafe at this, 

The worse for him. I like to speak my mind." 

And thus Ulysses, the sagacious, spake : 
" Nor do I wish, my friend, to loiter here. 
Better it is for one like me to beg =0 

In town than in the country. In the town, 
Whoever chooses will bestow his dole ; 
But here, if I remain about the stalls, 
I am no longer of an age to do 
All that a master may require. Go thou ; 25 

This man, at thy command, will lead me hence, 
As soon as I have warmed me at the fire, 
And the air grows milder. This keen morning-cold 
May end me, and the way, ye say, is long.'* 

He ended ; from the lodge Telemachus 3° 

Passed quickly, meditating to destroy 
The suitors. Coming to his stately home, 
He leaned his spear against a column's shaft, 
And, crossing the stone threshold, entered in. 
First Eurycleia, who had been his nurse, 35 

Beheld him, as she spread the beautiful thrones 
With skins, and ran to him with weeping eyes ; 
And round him other handmaids of the house 
Of resolute Ulysses thronged. They gave 



90 The Odyssey. 

Fond welcome, kissing him upon the brow 4 

And shoulders. Issuing from her chamber next 
The chaste Penelope, like Dian's self 
In beauty, or like golden Venus, came, 
And, weeping, threw her arms about her son, 
And kissed him on his forehead and on both < 
His glorious eyes, and said, amidst her tears : — 

" Light of my eyes ! O my Telemachus ! 
Art thou, then, come ? I never thought again 
To see thee, when I heard thou hadst embarked 
For Pylos, — secretly, and knowing me j 

Unwilling, — in the hope to gather there 
Some tidings of thy father. Tell me now 
All that has happened, all that thou hast seen." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 
" Nay, mother, waken not my griefs again, « 

Nor move my heart to rage. I have just now 
Escaped a cruel death. But go and bathe, 
And put fresh garments on, and when thou com'st 
Into thy chamber with thy maidens, make 
A vow to all the gods that thou wilt burn < 

A sacrifice of chosen hecatombs 
When Jupiter shall have avenged our wrongs. 
Now must I hasten to the market-place 
In quest of one who came with me a guest 
From Pylos. Him, with all my faithful crew, « 
I sent before me to this port, and bade 
Piraeus lead him to his own abode, 
There to be lodged and honored till I came." 



Book XVII. 91 

He spake, nor flew his words unheeded by. 
The princess bathed, and put fresh garments on, 70 
And vowed to all the gods a sacrifice 
Of chosen hecatombs when Jupiter 
Should punish the wrong-doers. While she prayed, 
Telemachus went forth, his spear in hand. 
Two fleet dogs followed him. Minerva shed 75 

A godlike beauty o'er his form and face, 
And all the people wondered as he came. 
The suitors thronged around him with smooth words, 
Yet plotting mischief in their hearts. He turned 
From their assembly hastily, and took 80 

His place where Mentor sat with Antiphus, 
And Halitherses, — all his father's friends 
And his from the beginning. While they asked 
Of all that he had seen, Piraeus came, 
The famous spearman, bringing through the town 85 
The stranger with him to the market-place. 
Nor long Telemachus delayed, but came 
To meet his guest, and then Piraeus said : — 

" Telemachus, despatch to where I dwell 
Thy serving-women ; I would send to thee, 90 

At once, the gifts which Menelaus gave." 

" And then discreet Telemachus replied : 
* We know not yet, Piraeus, what may be 
The event ; and if the suitors privily 
Should slay me in the palace, and divide 95 

The inheritance among them, I prefer 
That thou, instead of them, shouldst have the gifts ; 



92 The Odyssey. 

But should they meet the fate which I have planned, 

And be cut off, then shalt thou gladly bring 

The treasures, which I gladly will receive." k» 

So spake the prince, and to the palace led 
The unhappy man, his guest. When now they 

reached 
The stately pile, they both laid down their cloaks 
Upon the benches, and betook themselves 
To the well-polished baths. The attendant maids 105 
There ministered and smoothed their limbs with oil, 
And each received a tunic at their hands, 
And fleecy mantle. Then they left the baths 
And took their seats. A damsel came, and poured 
Water from a fair ewer wrought of gold iifa 

Into a silver basin for their hands, 
And spread a polished table near their seats ; 
And there the matron of the household placed 
Bread, and the many dishes which her stores 
Supplied. The queen was seated opposite, «s 

Beside a column of the pile, and twirled 
A slender spindle, while the son and guest 
Put forth their hands and shared the meal prepared. 
And when the calls of hunger and of thirst 
Had ceased, thus spake the sage Penelope : — x» 

" Telemachus, when I again go up 
Into my chamber, I shall lay me down 
Upon the couch which, since Ulysses sailed 
For Troy with Atreus' sons, has been to me 
A couch of mourning, sprinkled with my tears. ** 



Book XVII. 93 

And now thou hast not chosen to reveal, 
Ere yet the haughty suitors throng again 
Into these halls, what in thy voyage thou 
Hast haply heard concerning his return." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : 130 

" Then, mother, will I truly tell thee all. 
We went to Pylos, and saw Nestor there, 
The shepherd of the people. Kindly he 
Received me in his stately home, as one 
Might welcome back a wandering son returned 13s 
From foreign lands. Such welcome I received 
Both from the king and his illustrious sons. 
Put he had heard, he said, from living man, 
No tidings of the much-enduring chief 
Ulysses, whether he were yet alive 140 

Or dead. He therefore sent me with his steeds 
And chariot to the court of Atreus' son, 
The warlike Menelaus. There I saw 
The Argive Helen, for whose sake the Greeks 
And Trojans, by the appointment of the gods, 14s 
Suffered so much. The valiant king inquired 
What wish of mine had brought me to the town 
Of hallowed Lacedsemon. I replied, 
And truly told him all, and everything 
In order. Then he answered me, and said : — isc 

" ' So then ! these men, unwarlike as they are, 
Aspire to occupy a brave man's bed, 
As when a hart hath left two suckling fawns, 
Just born, asleep in a strong lion's lair, 



94 The Odyssey. 

And roams for pasturage the mountain slopes *ss 

And grassy lawns, the lion suddenly 

Comes back, and makes a cruel end of both, 

So will Ulysses bring a sudden doom 

Upon the suitors. Would to Father Jove, 

And Pallas, and Apollo, that the chief, ^ 

Returning mighty, as he was when once 

In well-built Lesbos, at a wrestling-match, 

He rose to strive with Philomelides, 

And threw him heavily, and all the Greeks 

Rejoiced, — would he might come as then he was ! 

Short-lived would then the suitors be, and taste m 

A bitter marriage-feast. But now, to come 

To what thou hast inquired, I will not seek 

To turn from it, and talk of other things, 

Nor will deceive. Of all that I was told 170 

By the Ancient of the Deep, whose words are true, 

I will not hide a single word from thee. 

He saw thy father in an isle, he said, 

A prey to wasting sorrows, and detained, 

Unwilling, in the palace of the nymph 17s 

Calypso. To the country of his birth 

He cannot come ; no ships are there with oars 

And crew to bear him o'er the great wide sea/ 

" Thus Menelaus, mighty with the spear, 
The son of Atreus, said. And having now 1* 

Fulfilled my errand, I returned. The gods 
Gave favoring winds, and sent me swiftly home." 

He ended, and the queen was deeply moved, 



Book XVII. 95 

Then Theoclymenus, the godlike, said : — 

" O gracious consort of Laertes' son, 185 

King Menelaus knew not all. Hear now 
What I shall say, — for I will prophesy, 
And truly, nor will keep back aught from thee. 
Let Jupiter, the mightiest of the gods, 
And this thy hospitable board, and this 19c 

The hearth of great Ulysses, where I find 
A refuge, be my witnesses, that now 
Ulysses is in his own land again, 
And sits or walks observant of the deeds 
Of wrong, and planning vengeance, yet to fall 19s 
On all the suitors ; such the augury 
Which I beheld when in the gallant bark 
I sat and told it t£> Telemachus." 

And thus the sage Penelope replied : 
" O stranger ! may thy saying be fulfilled ! 300 

Then shalt thou have such thanks and such rewards 
That all who greet thee shall rejoice with thee." 

So talked they with each other. In the space 
Before the palace of Ulysses stood 
The suitors, pleased with hurling quoits and spears 
On the smooth pavement, where their insolence 206 
So oft was seen. But when the supper-hour 
Was near, and from the fields the cattle came, 
Driven by the herdsmen, Medon — he whom most 
They liked of all the heralds, and who sat 210 

Among them at the feast — bespake them thus : — 

" Youths ! since ye now have had your pnstime 
here, 



96 The Odyssey. 

Come in, and help prepare the evening meal ; 
At the due hour a banquet is not ill." 

He spake ; the suitors hearkened and obeyed, 21s 
And rose, and came into the halls, and laid 
Their cloaks upon the benches and the thrones, 
And slaughtered well-fed sheep and fading goats, 
And made a victim of a pampered brawn, 
And a stalled ox, preparing for the feast. **> 

Meantime Ulysses and that noble hind 
The swineherd hastened to begin their walk 
To town, and thus the master swineherd spake : — 

" Since, stranger, 't is thy wish to pass to-day 
Into the city, as my master bade, — 225 

Though I by far prefer that thou remain 
A guardian of the stalls, yet mucji I fear 
My master, and am sure that he would chide, 
And harsh the upbraidings of a master are, — 
Let us depart ; the day is now far spent, 230 

\nd chill will be the air of eventide." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" Enough ; I know ; thy words are heard by one 
Who understands them. Let us then depart. 
Lead thou the way ; and if thou hast a staff, 2 3S 

Cut from the wood to lean on, give it me, 
Since, as thou say'st, we have a slippery road." 

He spake, and o'er his shoulders flung a scrip, 
Old, cracked, and hanging by a twisted thong. 
Eumaeus gave the staff he asked, and both 24a 

Went forth ; the dogs and herdsmen stayed to guard 



Book X VII. 97 

The lodge. The swineherd led his master on 

Townward, a squalid beggar to the sight, 

And aged, leaning on a staff, and wrapped 

In sordid rags. There by the rugged way, ^ 

As they drew near the town, they passed a fount 

Wrought by the hand of man, and pouring forth 

Its pleasant streams, from which the citizens 

Drew water. Ithacus and Neritus 

Founded it with Polyctor, and a grove & 

Of alders feeding on the moistened earth 

Grew round it on all sides. The ice-cold rill 

Gushed from a lofty rock, upon whose brow 

An altar stood, at which the passers-by 

Worshipped, and laid their offerings for the Nymphs. 

There did Melanthius, son of Dolius, meet 250 

The twain, as he was driving to the town 

The finest goats of all the flocks, to make 

A banquet for the suitors ; with him went 

Two shepherds, following the flock. As soon 260 

As he beheld Eumaeus and his guest, 

He railed at them with rude and violent words, 

That made the anger of Ulysses rise. 

" See that vile fellow lead the vile about ! 
Thus ever doth some god join like with like. 26s 
Thou worthless swineherd ! whither wouldst thou 

take 
This hungry, haunting beggar-man, this pest 
Of feasts, who at the posts of many a door 
Against them rubs his shoulders, asking crusts, 

vol. 11. 5 G 



98 The Odyssey. 

Tripods or caldrons never. Shouldst thou leave 270 

The wretch to me, to watch my stalls, and sweep 

The folds, and bring fresh branches to the kids, 

He might by drinking whey get stouter thighs. 

But he has learned no good, and will refuse 

To work ; he better likes to stroll about *75 

With that insatiable stomach, asking alms 

To fill it. Let me tell thee what is sure 

To happen to him, should he ever come 

Into the palace of the glorious chief 

Ulysses. Many a footstool will be flung 2&> 

Around him by the hands of those who sit 

As guests, and they will tear the fellow's sides." 

He spake, and in his folly thrust his heel 
Against the hero's thigh. The blow moved not 
Ulysses from his path, nor swerved he aught, 285 
But meditated whether with a blow 
Of his good staff to take the fellow's life, 
Or lift him in the air and dash his head 
Against the ground. Yet he endured the affront 
And checked his wrath. The swineherd spake, and 
chid *>• 

The offender, and thus prayed with lifted hands: — 

" Nymphs of the fountain, born to Jupiter ! 
If e'er in sacrifice Ulysses burned 
To you the thighs of lambs and goats, o'erlaid 
With fat, be pleased to grant the prayer I make, 295 
That, guided by some deity, the chief 
May yet return. Then thy rude boasts would cease. 



Book XVII. 99 

Melanthius, which thou utterest in thy way 

From place to place while wandering through the 

town. 
Unfaithful shepherds make a perishing flock." 300 

Melanthius, keeper of the goats, rejoined : 
" 'T is wonderful how flippant is the cur, 
And shrewd ! But I shall carry him on board 
A good black ship, far off from Ithaca, 
And there will sell him for a goodly price. 305 

Would that Apollo of the silver bow 
Might in the palace slay Telemachus 
This very hour, or that the suitors might, 
As certa : nly as that the day which brings 
Ulysses to his home will never dawn ! " 3« 

He spake, and left them there. They followed on 
Slowly. Melanthius hastened, and was soon 
At the king's palace gate, and, entering, took 
A seat right opposite Eurymachus, 
Whose favorite he was. The attendants there 315 
Brought meats, the matron of the household bread, 
And both were set before them. Meantime stopped 
Ulysses with the noble swineherd near 
The palace, for around them in the air 
Came the sweet murmurs of a lyre. Just then ■& 
Phemius, the minstrel, had begun his song, 
Ulysses took the swineherd's hand, and said : — 

" Eumaeus, this must be the noble pile 
In which Ulysses dwelt, for easily 
T is known among the others that are near. 32s 



ioo The Odyssey. 

Rooms over rooms are here ; around its court 
Are walls and battlements, and folding-doors 
Shut fast the entrance ; no man may contemn 
Its strength. And I perceive that many guests 
Banquet within ; the smoke of fat goes up, 330 

And the sweet lyre is heard ; the gods have given 
Its music to accompany the feast." 

And then, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply: 
" Thou speakest rightly, and in other things 
Thou art not slow of thought. Now let us think 
What we shall do. First enter, if thou wilt, 336 

The sumptuous rooms, while I remain without ; 
Or, if it please thee, I will enter first, 
While thou remainest ; yet delay not long, 
Lest some one, seeing thee, should deal a blow, 340 
Or drive thee hence. I pray thee, think of this." 

Ulysses, the great sufferer, answered thus : 
" Enough ; I know ; thy words are heard by one 
Who understands them. Go before me, then, 
And leave me here. I am not quite unused 345 
To blows and stripes, and patient is my mood, 
For greatly have I suffered, both at sea 
And in the wars ; and I submit to bear 
This also. But the stomach's eagerness 
Is desperate, and is not to be withstood, 3* 

And many are the mischiefs which it brings 
Upon the race of men ; it fits out fleets 
That cross the barren deep arrayed for war, 
And carry death and woe to hostile realms." 



Book XVII. 101 

So talked the twain. A dog was lying near, 355 
And lifted up his head and pricked his ears. 
'T was Argus, which the much-enduring man 
Ulysses long before had reared, but left 
Untried, when for the hallowed town of Troy 
He sailed. The young men oft had led him forth 3* 
In eager chase of wild goats, stags, and hares ; 
But now, his master far away, he lay 
Neglected, just before the stable doors, 
Amid the droppings of the mules and beeves, 
Heaped high till carried to the spacious fields 36s 
Of which Ulysses was the lord. There lay 
Argus, devoured with vermin. As he saw 
Ulysses drawing near, he wagged his tail 
And dropped his ears, but found that he could come 
No nearer to his master. Seeing this, 370 

Ulysses wiped away a tear unmarked 
By the good swineherd, whom he questioned thus : — 

" Eumaeus, this I marvel at, — this dog, 
That lies upon the dunghill, beautiful 
In form, but whether in the chase as fleet 375 

As he is fairly shaped I cannot tell. 
Worthless, perchance, as house-dogs often are, 
Whose masters keep them for the sake of show." 

And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply : 
" The dog belongs to one who died afar. 380 

Had he the power of limb which once he had 
For feats of hunting when Ulysses sailed 
For Troy and left him, thou wouldst be amazed 



102 The Odyssey. 

Both at his swiftness and his strength. No beast 

In the thick forest depths which once he saw, & 

Or even tracked by footprints, could escape. 

And now he is a sufferer, since his lord 

Has perished far from his own land. No more 

The careless women heed the creature's wants ; 

For, when the master is no longer near, 390 

The servants cease from their appointed tasks, 

And on the day that one becomes a slave 

The Thunderer, Jove, takes half his worth away." 

He spake, and, entering that fair dwelling-place, 
Passed through to where the illustrious suitors sat, 395 
While over Argus the black night of death 
Came suddenly as soon as he had seen 
Ulysses, absent now for twenty years. 
Telemachus, the godlike, was the first 
To mark the swineherd coming through the hall, 400 
And, nodding, called to him. The swineherd looked 
About him, and beheld a seat on which 
The carver of the feast was wont to sit, 
Distributing the meats. He bore it thence 
And placed it opposite Telemachus, 40s 

And at his table. Then he sat him down, 
And thither came the herald, bringing him 
A portion of the feast, and gave him bread 
From the full canister. Soon after him 
Ulysses entered, seemingly an old 4*0 

A.nd wretched beggar, propped upon a staff, 
And wrapped in sordid weeds. He sat him down 



Book XVII. 103 

On the ashen threshold, just within the doors, 
And leaned against a shaft of cypress-wood, 
Which some artificer had skilfully 41s 

Wrought by a line, and smoothed. Telemachus 
Called to the swineherd, bade him come, and took 
A loaf that lay in the fair canister, 
And all the flesh which his two hands could grasp. 

" Bear this to yonder stranger ; bid him go 420 
And ask a dole from every suitor here. 
No beggar should be bashful in his need." 

He spake, the hind obeyed, and, drawing near 
Ulysses, said to him in winged words : — 

" These from Telemachus, who bids thee ask 42s 
A dole from every suitor, for he says 
No beggar should be bashful in his need." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
" May Jove, the sovereign, make Telemachus 
A happy man among the sons of men, 43* 

And grant him all his heart desires in life!" 

He spake, and took the gift in both his hands, 
And laid it down upon his tattered scrip 
Close to his feet. Then, while the poet sang, 
He ate, and, just as he had supped, the bard 435 
Closed his divine recital. Then ensued 
Great clamor in the hall, but Pallas came 
And moved Ulysses to arise, and ask 
From every suitor there a dole of bread, 
That he might know the better from the worse, 440 
Though none were to be spared. From right to left 



104 ^%* Odyssey. 

He took his way, and asked of every man, 
With outstretched hand, as if he had been long 
A beggar. And they pitied him, and gave, 
And looked at him with wonder, and inquired 44s 
One of another who he was, and whence. 
Then spake Melanthius, keeper of the goats : — 

" Give ear, ye suitors of the illustrious queen. 
As to this stranger, I have seen him once. 
The swineherd brought him ; but I know him not, 450 
And of what race he is I cannot tell." 

He spake ; Antinoiis chid the swineherd thus : 
" Why hast thou brought him, too well known thy- 
self? 
Have we not vagabonds enough ? enough 
Of sturdy beggars, pests of every feast. 4ss 

Or is it a light matter that they throng 
Hither to waste the substance of thy lord, 
And therefore thou art with this fellow here ? " 

And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply : 
" Antinoiis, high as is thy station, thou 460 

Hast spoken ill. What man goes ever forth 
To bid a stranger to his house, unless 
The stranger be of those whose office is 
To serve the people, be he seer, or leech, 
Or architect, or poet heaven-inspired, 4» 

Whose song is gladly heard ? All these are called 
To feasts wherever men are found ; but none 
Call in the poor, to live upon their means. 
Antinoiis, thou, of all the suitor-train, 



Book XVII. 105 

Dost ever with the greatest harshness treat 470 

The servants of Ulysses, chiefly me. 

I heed it not while sage Penelope 

Dwells in the palace with her godlike son." 

Then interposed discreet Telemachus : 
" Nay, have no strife of words with him, I pray. 47s 
Antinoiis takes delight in bitter words, 
And rails, and stirs up railing in the rest." 
And then he turned, and thus with winged words 
Bespake Antinoiis : " Truly thou dost care 
For me as might a father for a son, *a? 

Bidding me drive a stranger from my door 
With violent words, — which God forbid. Take now 
Somewhat and give to him. I grudge it not, 
Nay, I advise it. Fear not to offend 
My mother, or displease a single one 48s 

Of all the household of the godlike chief, 
Ulysses. But thou hast not thought of this. 
It suits thee best to feast and never give." 

Antinoiis thus rejoined : " O utterer 
Of big and braggart words ! Telemachus, 49° 

If all the other suitors would bestow 
As much as I will, he would not be seen 
Within these halls for three months yet to come." 

So speaking, he brought forward to the sight, 
From underneath the board, a stool, on which 493 
Rested his dainty feet. The others all 
Gave somewhat to Ulysses, till his scrip 
Was filled with meat and bread Then as he wenr 
5* 



106 The Odyssey. 

Back to the threshold, there to feast on what 
The Greeks had given him in his rounds, he stoppe - 
Beside Antinoiis, and bespake him thus : — 50 

"Give somewhat also, friend. Thou dost not 
seem 
One of the humbler rank among the Greeks, 
But of the highest. Kingly is thy look ; 
It therefore will become thee to bestow 5 °s 

More freely than the rest, and I will sound 
Thy praise through all the earth. Mine too was once 
A happy lot, for I inhabited 
A palace filled with goods, and often gave 
To wanderers, whosoever they might be s*> 

That sought me out, and in whatever need. 
And I had many servants, and large store 
Of everything by which men live at ease 
And are accounted rich. Saturnian Jove — 
Such was his pleasure — brought me low; for, moved 
By him, I joined me to a wandering band 516 

Of pirates, and to my perdition sailed 
Upon a distant voyage to the coast 
Of Egypt. In the river of that land 
I stationed my good ships, and bade my men ™ 
Remain with them and watch them well. I placed 
Sentries upon the heights. Yet confident 
In their own strength, and rashly giving way 
To greed, my comrades ravaged the fair fields 
Of the Egyptians, slew them, and bore off 52s 

Their wives and little ones. The rumor reached 



Book XVII. 107 

The city soon ; the people heard the alarm 
And came together. With the dawn of day 
All the great plain was thronged with horse and foot, 
And gleamed with brass, while Jove, the Thunderer, 
sent 530 

A deadly fear into our ranks, where none 
Dared face the foe. On every side was death. 
The Egyptians hew r ed down many with the sword, 
And some they led away alive to toil 
For them in slavery. Me my captors gave 53s 

Into a stranger's hands, upon his way 
To Cyprus, where he reigned, a mighty king, 
Demetor, son of Jasus. Thence at last 
I came through many hardships to this isle." 

Antinoiis lifted up his voice, and said : 54s 

" What god hath sent this nuisance to disturb 
The banquet ? Take thyself to the mid-hall, 
Far from thy table, else expect to see 
An Egypt and a Cyprus of a sort 
That thou wilt little like. Thou art a bold 545 

And shameless beggar. Thou dost take thy round 
And ask from each, and foolishly they give, 
And spare not nor consider ; well supplied 
Is each, and freely gives what is not his." 

Then sage Ulysses said as he withdrew : 550 

" 'T is strange ; thy mind agrees not with thy form. 
Thou wouldst not give a suppliant even salt 
In thine own house, — thou who, while sitting here 
Fed at another's table, canst not bear 



108 The Odyssey. 

To give me bread from thy well-loaded board." sai 

He spake. Antinous grew more angry still, 
And frowned and answered him with winged 
words : — 

" Dealer in saucy words ! I hardly think 
That thou wilt leave this palace unchastised." 

He spake, and raised the footstool in his hand, s^ 
And smote Ulysses on the lower part 
Of the right shoulder. Like a rock he stood, 
Unmoved beneath the blow Antinous gave, 
But shook his head in silence as he thought 
Of vengeance. Then, returning, he sat down 565 
Upon the threshold, where he laid his scrip 
Well filled, and thus bespake the suitor-train : — 

" Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious queen. 
Grief or resentment no man feels for blows 
Received by him while fighting for his own, — 570 
His beeves or white-woolled sheep. But this man 

here, 
Antinous, dealt that blow on me because 
I have an empty stomach ; hunger brings 
Great mischiefs upon men. If there be gods 
Or furies who avenge the poor, may death 575 

O'ertake Antinous ere his marriage-day ! " 

He ended. Then again Eupeithes' son, 
Antinous, spake : " Eat, stranger, quietly ; 
Sit still, or get thee hence ; our young men else 
Who hear thy words will seize thee by the feet s?o 
Or hands, and drag thee forth and flay thee there/' 



Book XVII. 109 

He spake, and greatly were the rest incensed, 
And one of those proud youths took up the word : — ■ 

" Antinous, it was ill of thee to smite 
That hapless wanderer. Madman ! what if he 58s 
Came down from heaven and were a god ! The gods 
Put on the form of strangers from afar, 
And walk our towns in many different shapes, 
To mark the good and evil deeds of men." 

Thus spake the suitors, but he heeded not 59c 
Their words. Telemachus, who saw the blow, 
Felt his heart swell with anger and with grief, 
Yet from his eyelids fell no tear ; he shook 
His head in silence, pondering to repay 
The wrong. Meantime the sage Penelope 395 

Heard of the stranger smitten in her halls, 
And thus bespake the maidens of her train : — ~ 

" Would that Apollo, mighty with the bow, 
Might smite thee also ! " Then Eurynome, 
The matron of the household, said in turn : 600 

" O, were our prayers but heard, not one of these 
Should look upon the golden morn again ! " 

Then spake again the sage Penelope : 
" Mother, they all are hateful ; every one 
Plots mischief, but Antinous most of all ; 60s 

And he is like black death, to be abhorred. 
A friendless stranger passes through these halls, 
Compelled by need, and asks an alms of each, 
And all the others give, and fill his scrip ; 
Antinous flings a footstool, and the blow

Bruises the shoulder of the suppliant man." 

So talked they with each other where they sat 
In the queen's chamber, 'mid the attendant train 
Of women, while meantime Ulysses took 
The evening meal. The queen then bade to call e* 
The noble swineherd, and bespake him thus : — 

" My worthy friend Eumaeus, go and bring 
The stranger hither. I would speak with him, 
And ask if anywhere he saw or heard 
Aught of Ulysses ; for he seems like one «» 

Whose wanderings have been in many lands." 
And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply : 
" Would that these Greeks, O queen, would hold 

their peace, 
Then might this stranger in thy hearing speak 
Words full of consolation. For three nights ^s 

I had him with me, for three days I made 
My lodge his home, — for at the very first 
He came to me, escaping from his ship, — 
Nor when he left me had he told of all 
That he had suffered. As a hearer looks 630 

Upon a minstrel whom the gods have taught 
To sing the poems that delight all hearts, 
And, listening, longs to listen without end ; 
So, as the stranger sat beneath my roof, 
He held me charmed. He was the ancestral friend, 
He said, of thy Ulysses, and his home ^ 

Was Crete, where dwells the stock of Minos yet. 
From Crete he came, and much had suffered since, 



Book XVII. in 

Driven on from place to place. And he had heard 
Some tidings of Ulysses yet alive — 6 4 o 

So he affirmed — in a rich region near 
The realm of the Thesprotians, and prepared 
To bring much riches to his native isle." 

Then spake the sage Penelope again : 
" Go, call him hither, that he may relate «*5 

His story in my presence. Let these men, 
As it may please them, sitting at our gates 
Or in our halls, amuse themselves, for light 
Are they of heart. Unwasted in their homes 
Lie their possessions, and their bread and wine 650 
Are only for their servants, while themselves 
Frequent our palace, day by day, and slay 
Our beeves and sheep and fatling goats, and feast, 
And drink abundantly the dark red wine, 
And all with lavish waste. No man is here, 655 
Such as Ulysses was, to drive away 
This pest from our abode. Should he return 
To his own land, he and his son would take 
Swift vengeance on the men who do him wrong." 

She ended. Suddenly Telemachus 660 

Sneezed loudly, so that all the palace rang ; 
And, laughing as she heard, Penelope 
Bespake Eumaeus thus with winged words : — 

" Go, call the stranger. Dost thou not perceive 
My son has sneezed as to confirm my words. «& 
Not unfulfilled will now remain the doom 
That waits the suitors ; none will now escape 



112 The Odyssey. 

Death and the Fates. This further let me say, 
And thou remember it ; if what he tells 
Be true, I will bestow on him a change 670 

Of fair attire, a tunic and a cloak." 

She spake, the swineherd went, and, drawing near 
Ulysses, said to him in winged words : — 

" Stranger and father, sage Penelope, 
The mother of the prince, hath sent for thee. o 7S 
Though sorrowing, she is minded to inquire 
What of her husband thou canst haply say ; 
And should she find that all thy words are true, 
She will bestow a tunic and a cloak, 
Garments wMch much thou needest. For thy food, 
What will appease thy hunger thou wilt find 68i 

Among the people ; ask, and each will give." 

Ulysses, much-enduring man, replied : 
" Eumaeus, faithfully will I declare 
All that I know to sage Penelope, a; 

The daughter of Icarius. Well I knew 
Her husband, and with like calamities 
We both have suffered. But I greatly dread 
This reckless suitor-crew, whose riotous acts 
And violence reach to the iron heavens. 690 

Even now, when that man dealt me, as I passed, 
A painful blow, though I had done no harm, 
None interposed, not even Telemachus, 
In my defence. Now, therefore, ask, I pray, 
Penelope that she will deign to wait 695 

Till sunset in her rooms, though strong her wish 



Book XVII. 113 

To hear my history. Of her husband then, 
And his return, she may inquire, while I 
Sit by the blazing hearth ; for scant have been 
My garments, as thou knowest, since the day 700 
When first I came, a suppliant, to thy door." 

He spake ; the swineherd went, and as he crossed 
The threshold of Penelope she said : — 

" Thou bringst him not, Eumaeus ? What may be 
The wanderer's scruple ? Fear of some one here ? 705 
Or in a palace is he filled with awe ? 
To be a bashful beggar is most hard." 

And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst answer her : 
" Rightly he speaks, and just as one would think 
Who shuns the encounter of disorderly men. 710 
He prays that thou wilt wait till set of sun ; 
And better were it for thyself, O queen, 
To speak with him and hear his words alone." 

Then spake discreet Penelope again : 
" Whoe'er may be the stranger, not unwise 715 

He seems ; for nowhere among men are done 
Such deeds of wrong and outrage as by these." 

She spake, and the good swineherd, having told 
The lady all, went forth among the crowd 
Of suitors, drawing near Telemachus, 720 

And bowed his head beside him that none else 
Might hear, and said to him in winged words : — 

" I go, my friend, to tend the swine and guard 
What there thou hast, thy sustenance and mine. 
The charge of what is here belongs to thee. 72s 

H 



114 The Odyssey. 

Be thy first care to save thyself, and watch 
To see that mischief overtake thee not, — 
For many are the Achaians plotting it, 
Whom Jove destroy ere we become their prey ! " 

Then spake discreet Telemachus in turn : 73* 

" So be it, father, and, when thou hast supped, 
Depart, but with the morning come, and bring 
Choice victims for the sacrifice. The care 
Of all things here is with the gods and me." 

He spake • the swineherd sat him down again 73s 
Upon his polished seat, and satisfied 
His appetite and thirst with food and wine. 
Then he departed to his herd, and left 
The palace and the court before it thronged 
With revellers, who gave the hour to song, 740 

And joined the dance ; for evening now was come.
