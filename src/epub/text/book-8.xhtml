WHEN Morn appeared, the rosy-fingered child 
Of Dawn, Alcinoiis, mighty and revered, 
Rose from his bed. Ulysses, noble chief, 
Spoiler of cities, also left his couch. 
Alcinoiis, mighty and revered, went forth s 

Before, and led him to the market-place 
Of the Phaeacians, built beside the fleet, 
And there on polished stones they took their seats 
Near to each other. Pallas, who now seemed 
A herald of the wise Alcinoiis, went n 

Through all the city, planning how to send 
Magnanimous Ulysses to his home, 
And came and stood by every chief and said : — 

" Leaders and chiefs of the Phaeacians, come 
Speedily to the market-place, and there 15 

Hear of the stranger who from wandering o'er 
The deep has come where wise Alcinoiis holds 
His court ; in aspect he is like the gods." 

She spake, and every mind and heart was moved, 
And all the market-place and all its seats f> 

Were quickly filled with people. Many gazed, 
Admiring, on Laertes' well-graced son ; 
For on his face and form had Pallas shed 
A glory, and had made him seem more tall 
And of an ampler bulk, that he might find er 

Favor with the Phaeacians, and be deemed 



t$2 The Odyssey. 

Worthy of awe and able to achieve 

The many feats which the Phaeacian chiefs, 

To try the stranger's prowess, might propose. 

And now when all the summoned had arrived, 
Alcinous to the full assembly spake : — 

" Princes and chiefs of the Phaeacians, hear : 
I speak the promptings of my heart. This guest 
I know him not — has come to my abode, 
A wanderer, — haply from the tribes who dwell 
In the far East, or haply from the West, — 
And asked an escort and safe-conduct home ; 
And let us make them ready, as our wont 
Has ever been. No stranger ever comes 
Across my threshold who is suffered long 
To pine for his departure. Let us draw 
A dark-hulled ship down to the holy sea 
On her first voyage. Let us choose her crew 
Among the people, two-and-fifty youths 
Of our best seamen. Then make fast the oars 
Beside the benches, leave them there, and come 
Into our palace and partake in haste 
A feast which I will liberally spread 
For all of you. This I command the youths ; 
But you, ye sceptred princes, come at once 
To my fair palace, that we there may pay 
The honors due our guest • let none refuse. 
Call also the divine Demodocus, 
The bard, on whom a deity bestowed 
In ample measure the sweet gift of song, 



Book VIII. 153 

Delightful when the spirit prompts the lay." 

He spake, and led the way ; the sceptred train 
Of princes followed him. The herald sought 
Meantime the sacred bard. The chosen youths 
Fifty-and-two betook them to the marge ec 

Of the unfruitful sea ; and when they reached 
The ship and beach they drew the dark hull down 
To the deep water, put the mast on board 
And the ship's sails, and fitted well the oars 
Into the leathern rings, and, having moored «s 

Their bark in the deep water, went with speed 
To their wise monarch in his spacious halls. 
There portico and court and hall were thronged 
With people, young and old in multitude ; 
And there Alcinoiis sacrificed twelve sheep, 70 

Eight white-toothed swine, and two splay-footed 

beeves. 
And these they flayed, and duly dressed, and made 
A noble banquet ready. Then appeared 
The herald, leading the sweet singer in, 
Him whom the Muse with an exceeding love is 
Had cherished, and had visited with good 
And evil, quenched his eyesight and bestowed 
Sweetness of song. Pontonoiis mid the guests 
Placed for the bard a silver-studded throne, 
Against a lofty column hung his harp &> 

Above his head, and taught him how to find 
And take it down. Near him the herald set 
A basket and fair table, and a cup 
7* 



154 Tke Odyssey. 

Of wine, that he might drink when he desired ; 
Then all put forth their hands and shared the feast. s s 

And when their thirst and hunger were allayed, 
The Muse inspired the bard to sing the praise 
Of heroes ; 't was a song whose fame had reached 
To the high heaven, a story of the strife 
Between Ulysses and Achilles, son 90 

Of Pe^eus, wrangling at a solemn feast 
Made for the gods. They strove with angry words, 
And Agamemnon, king of men, rejoiced 
To hear the noblest of the Achaian host 
Contending ; for all this had been foretold 95 

To him in sacred Pythia by the voice 
Of Phoebus, when the monarch to inquire 
At the oracle had crossed the rock which formed 
Its threshold. Then began the train of woes 
Which at the will of sovereign Jupiter 100 

Befell the sons of Ilium and of Greece. 

So sang renowned Demodocus. Meanwhile 
Ulysses took into his brawny hands 
An ample veil of purple, drawing it 
Around his head to hide his noble face, *>s 

Ashamed that the Phaeacians should behold 
The tears that flowed so freely from his lids. 
But when the sacred bard had ceased his song, 
He wiped the tears away and laid the veil 
Aside, and took a double beaker filled ™ 

With wine, and poured libations to the gods. 
Vet when again the minstrel sang, and all 



Book VI I L 155 

The chiefs of the Phaeacian people, charmed 
To hear his music, bade the strain proceed, 
Again Ulysses hid his face and wept. "5 

No other eye beheld the tears he shed. 
Alcinoiis only watched him, and perceived 
His grief, and heard the sighs he drew, and spake 
To the Phaeacians, lovers of the sea : — 

" Now that we all, to our content, have shared ™ 
The feast and heard the harp, whose notes so well 
Suit with a liberal banquet, let us forth 
And try our skill in games, that this our guest, 
.Returning to his country, may relate 
How in the boxing and the wrestling match, 12s 

In leaping and in running, we excel." 

He spake, and went before ; they followed him. 
Then did the herald hang the clear-toned harp 
Again on high, and taking by the band 
Demodocus, he led him from the place, 130 

Guiding him in the way which just before 
The princes of Phaeacia trod to see 
The public games. Into the market-place 
They went ; a vast innumerable crowd 
Pressed after. Then did many a valiant youth 135 
Arise, — Acroneus and Ocyalus, 
Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, after whom 
Upstood Anchialus, and by his side 
Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, rose ; 
Anabasineiis and Amphialus, mo 

A son of Polyneius, Tecton's son ; 



156 The Odyssey. 

Then rose the son of Naubolus, like Mars 

In warlike port, Euryalus by name, 

And goodliest both in feature and in form 

Of all Phaeacia's sons save one alone, us 

Laodamas the faultless. Next three sons 

Of King Alcinoiis rose : Laodamas, 

Halius, and Clytoneius, like a god 

In aspect. Some of these began the games, 

Contending in the race. For them a course 150 

Was marked from goal to goal. They darted forth 

At once and swiftly, raising, as they ran, 

The dust along the plain. The swiftest there 

Was Clytoneius in the race. As far 

As mules, in furrowing the fallow ground, ^5 

Gain on the steers, he ran before the rest, 

And reached the crowd, and left them all behind. 

Others in wrestling strove laboriously, — 

And here Euryalus excelled them all ; 

But in the leap Amphialus was first ; 160 

Elatreus flung the quoit with firmest hand ; 

And in the boxer's art Laodamas, 

The monarch's valiant son, was conqueror. 

This when the admiring multitude had seen, 
Thus spake the monarch's son, Laodamas : — ** 

" And now, my friends, inquire we of our guest 
If he has learned, and practised feats like these. 
For he is not ill-made in legs and thighs 
And in both arms, in firmly planted neck 
And strong-built frame ; nor does he seem to lack 170 



Book VIII. 157 

A certain youthful vigor, though impaired 
By many hardships, — for I know of naught 
That more severely tries the strongest man, 
And breaks him down, than perils of the sea." 

Euryalus replied : " Laodamas, I7S 

Well hast thou said, and rightly : go thou now 
And speak to him thyself, and challenge him." 

The son of King Alcinoiis, as he heard, 
Came forward, and bespake Ulysses thus : — 

" Thou also, guest and father, try these feats, & 
If thou perchance wert trained to them. I think 
Thou must be skilled in games, since there is not 
A greater glory for a man while yet 
He lives on earth than what he hath wrought out, 
By strenuous effort, with his feet and hands. 185 

Try, then, thy skill, and give no place to grief. 
Not long will thy departure be delayed ; 
Thy bark is launched ; the crew are ready here." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : — 
" Why press me, O Laodamas ! to try t q o 

These feats, when all my thoughts are of my woes, 
And not of games ? I, who have borne so much 
Of pain and toil, sit pining for my home 
In your assembly, supplicating here 
Your king and all the people of your land." 195 

Then spake Euryalus with chiding words : — 
" Stranger, I well perceive thou canst not boast, 
As many others can, of skill in games ; 
But thou art one of those who dwell in ships 



158 The Odyssey. 

With many benches, rulers o'er a crew 200 

Of sailors, — a mere trader looking out 
For freight, and watching o'er the wares that form 
The cargo. Thou hast doubtless gathered wealth 
By rapine, and art surely no athlete." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, frowned and said : — 205 
" Stranger, thou speakest not becomingly, 
But like a man who recks not what he says. 
The gods bestow not equally on all 
The gifts that men desire, — the grace of form, 
The mind, the eloquence. One man to sight 2^ 
Is undistinguished, but on him the gods 
Bestow the power of words. All look on him 
Gladly ; he knows whereof he speaks • his speech 
Is mild and modest ; he is eminent 
In all assemblies, and, whene'er he walks 215 

The city, men regard him as a god. 
Another in the form he wears is like 
The immortals, yet has he no power to speak 
Becoming words. So thou hast comely looks, — 
A god would not have shaped thee otherwise 22a 
Than we behold thee, — yet thy wit is small, 
And thy unmannerly words have angered me 
Even to the heart. Not quite unskilled am I 
In games, as thou dost idly talk, and once, 
When I could trust my youth and my strong arms, 223 
I think that in these contests I was deemed 
Among the first. But I am now pressed down 
With toil and sorrow ; much have I endured 



Book VII L 159 

In wars with heroes and on stormy seas. 
Yet even thus, a sufferer as I am, 230 

Will I essay these feats ; for sharp have been 
Thy words, and they provoke me to the proof." 

He spake, and rising with his mantle on 
He seized a broader, thicker, heavier quoit, 
By no small odds, than the Phaeacians used, 33s 

And swinging it around with vigorous arm 
He sent it forth • it sounded as it went ; 
And the Phaeacians, skilful with the oar 
And sail, bent low as o'er them, from his hand, 
Flew the swift stone beyond the other marks. 240 
And Pallas, in a human form, set up 
A mark where it descended, and exclaimed : — 

" Stranger ! a blind man, groping here, could find 
Thy mark full easily, since it is not 
Among the many, but beyond them all. 24s 

Then fear thou nothing in this game at least ; 
For no Phaeacian here can throw the quoit 
As far as thou, much less exceed thy cast." 

She spake ; Ulysses the great sufferer 
Heard, and rejoiced to know he had a friend 250 
In that great circle. With a lighter heart 
Thus said the chief to the Phaeacian crowd : — 

" Follow that cast, young men, and I will send 
Another stone, at once, as far, perchance, 
Or further still. If there are others yet 25S 

Who feel the wish, let them come forward here, — 
For much your words have chafed me, — let them try 



160 The Odyssey. 

With me the boxing or the wrestling match, 

Or foot-race ; there is naught that I refuse, — 

Any of the Phaeacians. I except *» 

Laodamas ; he is my host, and who 

Would enter such a contest with a friend ? 

A senseless, worthless man is he who seeks 

A strife like this with one who shelters him 

In a strange land ; he mars the welcome given. 265 

As for the rest, there is no rival here 

Whom I reject or scorn ; for I would know 

Their prowess, and would try my own with theirs 

Before you all. At any of the games 

Practised among mankind I am not ill, 2,-0 

Whatever they may be. The polished bow 

I well know how to handle. I should be 

The first to strike a foe by arrows sent 

Among a hostile squadron, though there stood 

A crowd of fellow-warriors by my side 275 

And also aimed their shafts. The only one 

Whose skill in archery excelled my own, 

When we Achaians drew the bow at Troy, 

Was Philoctetes ; to all other men 

On earth that live by bread I hold myself =s° 

Superior. Yet I claim no rivalry 

With men of ancient times, — with Hercules 

And Eurytus the CEchalian, who defied 

The immortals to a contest with the bow. 

Therefore was mighty Eurytus cut off. 385 

Apollo, angry to be challenged, slew 



Book VIII. 161 

The hero. I can hurl a spear beyond 

Where others send an arrow. All my fear 

Is for my feet, so weakened have I been 

Among the stormy waves with want of food 390 

At sea, and thus my limbs have lost their strength." 

He ended here, and all the assembly sat 
In silence ; King Alcinoiis only spake : — 

" Stranger, since thou dost speak without orfence, 
And but to assert the prowess of thine arm, 29s 

Indignant that amid the public games 
This man should rail at thee, and since thy wish 
Is only that all others who can speak 
Becomingly may not in time to come 
Dispraise that prowess, now, then, heed my words, 300 
And speak of them within thy palace halls 
To other heroes when thou banquetest 
Beside thy wife and children, and dost think 
Of things that we excel .in, — arts which Jove 
Gives us, transmitted from our ancestors. 3°s 

In boxing and in wrestling small renown 
Have we, but we are swift of foot ; we guide 
Our galleys bravely o'er the deep ; we take 
Delight in feasts ; we love the harp, the dance, 
And change of raiment, the warm bath and bed. 310 
Rise, then, Phaeacian masters of the dance, 
And tread your measures, that our guest may tell 
His friends at home how greatly we surpass 
All other men in seamanship, the race, 
The dance, the art of song. Go, one of you, 3* 



1 62 The Odyssey. 

And bring Demodocus his clear-toned harp, 
That somewhere in our palace has been left." 

Thus spake the godlike king. The herald rose 
To bring the sweet harp from the royal house. 
Then the nine umpires also rose, who ruled 3^ 

The games ; they smoothed the floor, and made the 

ring 
Of gazers wider. Next the herald came, 
And brought Demodocus the clear-toned harp. 
The minstrel went into the midst, and there 
Gathered the graceful dancers ; they were youths 325 
In life's first bloom. With even steps they smote 
The sacred floor. Ulysses, gazing, saw 
The twinkle of their feet and was amazed. 
The minstrel struck the chords and gracefully 
Began the lay : he sang the loves of Mars 330 

And Venus of the glittering crown, who first 
Had met each other stealthily beneath 
The roof of Vulcan. Mars with many gifts 
Won her, and wronged her spouse, the King of Fire ; 
But from the Sun, who saw their guilt, there came 335 
A messenger to Vulcan. When he heard 
The unwelcome tidings, planning his revenge, 
He hastened to his smithy, where he forged 
Chains that no power might loosen or might break, 
Made to hold fast forever. When the snare *** 

In all its parts was finished, he repaired, 
Angry with Mars, to where the marriage-bed 
Stood in his chamber. To the posts he tied 



Book VIII. 163 

The encircling chains on every side, and made 

Fast to the ceiling many, like the threads 345 

Spun by the spider, which no eye could see, 

Not even of the gods, so artfully 

He wrought them. Then, as soon as he had wrapped 

The snare about the bed, he feigned to go 

To Lemnos nobly built, most dear to him 350 

Of all the lands. But Mars, the god who holds 

The shining reins, had kept no careless watch, 

And when he saw the great artificer 

Depart he went with speed to Vulcan's house, 

Drawn thither by the love of her who wears 35s 

The glittering crown. There Cytherea sat, 

Arrived that moment from a visit paid. 

Entering, he took her by the hand and said : — 

" Come, my beloved, let us to the couch. 
Vulcan is here no longer ; he is gone, 360 

And is among the Sintians, men who speak 
A barbarous tongue, in Lemnos far away." 

He spake, and she approved his words, and both 
Lay down upon the bed, when suddenly 
The network, wrought by Vulcan's skilful hand, 365 
Caught them, and clasped them round, nor could 

they lift 
Or move a limb, and saw that no escape 
Was possible. And now approached the King 
Of Fire, returning ere he reached the isle 
Of Lemnos, for the Sun in his behalf 370 

Kept watch and told him alL He hastened home 



164 The Odyssey. 

Tn bitterness of heart, but when he reached 
The threshold stopped. A fury without bounds 
Possessed him, and he shouted terribly, 
And called aloud on all the gods of heaven : — 3» 

" O Father Jove, and all ye blessed ones, 
And deathless ! Come, for here is what will move 
Your laughter, yet is not to be endured. 
Jove's daughter, Venus, thus dishonors me, 
Lame as I am, and loves the butcher Mars ; 38* 

For he is well to look at, and is sound 
Of foot, while I am weakly, — but for this 
Are none but my two parents to be blamed, 
Who never should have given me birth. Behold 
Where lie embraced the lovers in my bed, — 38s 
A hateful sight. Yet they will hardly take 
Even a short slumber there, though side by side, 
Enamored as they are ; nor will they both 
Be drowsy very soon. The net and chains 
Will hold them till her father shall restore 35* 

All the large gifts which, on our marriage-day, 
I gave him to possess the impudent minx 
His daughter, who is fair, indeed, but false." 

He spake, and to the brazen palace flocked 
The gods ; there Neptune came, who shakes the 
earth ; 395 

There came beneficent Hermes ; there too came 
Apollo, archer-god ; the goddesses, 
Through womanly reserve, remained at home. 
Meantime the gods, the givers of ail good, 



Book VIII. 165 

Stood in the entrance ; and as they beheld 4*0 

The cunning snare of Vulcan, there arose 
Infinite laughter from the blessed ones, 
And one of them bespake his neighbor thus : — 

" Wrong prospers not ; the slow o'ertakes the 
swift. 
Vulcan the slow has trapped the fleetest god 405 
Upon Olympus, Mars ; though lame himself, 
His net has taken the adulterer, 
Who now must pay the forfeit of his crime." 

So talked they with each other. Then the son 
Of Jove, Apollo, thus to Hermes said : — 410 

" Hermes, thou son and messenger of Jove, 
And bountiful of gifts, couldst thou endure, 
Fettered with such strong chains as these, to lie 
Upon a couch with Venus at thy side ? " 

The herald-god, the Argus-queller, thus 415 

Made answer : " Nay, I would that it were so, 
O archer-king, Apollo ; I could bear 
Chains thrice as many, and of infinite strength, 
And all the gods and all the goddesses 
Might come to look upon me, I would keep 4*3 

My place with golden Venus at my side." 

He spake, and all the immortals laughed to 
hear. 
Neptune alone laughed not, but earnestly 
Prayed Vulcan, the renowned artificer, 
To set Mars free, and spake these winged words : — 425 

" Release thy prisoner. What thou dost require 



1 66 The Odyssey. 

I promise here, — that he shall make to thee 
Due recompense in presence of the gods." 

Illustrious Vulcan. answered : "Do not lay, 
Earth-shaking Neptune, this command on me, 430 
Since little is the worth of pledges given 
For worthless debtors. How could I demand 
My right from thee among the assembled gods, 
If Mars, set free, escape from debt and chains ? " 

Again the god who shakes the earth replied : — 435 
" Vulcan, though Mars deny the forfeit due, 
And take to flight, it shall be paid by me." 

Again illustrious Vulcan said : " Thy word 
I ought not and I seek not to decline." 

He spake, and then the might of Vulcan loosed 440 
The net, and, freed from those strong fetters, both 
The prisoners sprang away. Mars flew to Thrace, 
And laughter-loving Venus to the isle 
Of Cyprus, where at Paphos stand her grove 
And perfumed altar. Here the Graces gave 44s 
The bath, anointed with ambrosial oil 
Her limbs, — such oil as to the eternal gods 
Lends a fresh beauty, and arrayed her last 
In graceful robes, a marvel to behold. 

So sang the famous bard, while inly pleased 450 
Ulysses heard, and pleased were all the rest, 
Phaeacia's sons, expert with oar and sail. 

Alcinoiis called his sons Laodamas 
And Halius forth, and bade them dance alone, 
For none of all the others equalled them. 45s 



Book VIII. 167 

Then taking a fair purple ball, the work 

Of skilful Polybus, and, bending back, 

One flung it toward the shadowy clouds on high, 

The other springing upward easily 

Grasped it before he touched the ground again. 4& 

And when they thus had tossed the ball awhile, 

They danced upon the nourishing earth, and oft 

Changed places with each other, while the youths, 

That stood within the circle filled the air 

With their applauses ; mighty was the din. 465 

Then great Ulysses to Alcinoiis said : — 

" O King Alcinoiis ! mightiest of the race 
For whom thou hast engaged that they excel 
All others in the dance, what thou hast said 
Is amply proved. I look and am amazed." 470 

Well pleased Alcinoiis the mighty heard, 
And thus to his seafaring people spake : — 

" Leaders and chiefs of the Phaeacians, hear ! 
Wise seems the stranger. Haste we to bestow 
Gifts that may well beseem his liberal hests. 47s 

Twelve honored princes in our land bear sway, 
The thirteenth prince am I. Let each one bring 
A well-bleached cloak, a tunic, and beside 
Of precious gold a talent Let them all 
Be brought at once, that, having seen them here, 480 
Our guest may with a cheerful heart partake 
The evening meal. And let Euryalus, 
Who spake but now so unbecomingly, 
Appease him both with words and with a gift." 



1 68 The Odyssey. 

He spake ; they all approved, and each one sent #s 
His herald with a charge to bring the gifts, 
And thus Euryalus addressed the king : — 

" O King Alcinoiis, mightiest of our race, 
I will obey thee, and will seek to appease 
Our guest. This sword of brass will I bestow, 49« 
With hilt of silver, and an ivory sheath 
New wrought, which he may deem a gift of price.' , 

He spake, and gave the silver-studded sword 
Into his hand, and spake these winged words : — 

" Stranger and father, hail ! If any word 495 

That hath been uttered gave offence, may storms 
Sweep it away forever. May the gods 
Give thee to see thy wife again, and reach 
Thy native land, where all thy sufferings 
And this long absence from thy friends shall end ! " 500 

Ulysses, the sagacious, thus replied : — 
" Hail also, friend ! and may the gods confer 
On thee all happiness, and may the time 
Never arrive when thou shalt miss the sword 
Placed in my hands with reconciling words ! " 50s 

He spake, and slung the silver-studded sword 
Upon his shoulders. Now the sun went down, 
And the rich presents were already brought. 
The noble heralds came and carried them 
Into the palace of Alcinoiis, where m 

His blameless sons received and ranged them all 
In fair array before the queenly dame 
Their mother. Meantime had the mighty king 



Book VIII. 169 

Alcinous to his palace led the way, 

Where they who followed took the lofty seats, 51s 

And thus Alcinous to Arete said : — 

" Bring now a coffer hither, fairly shaped, 
The best we have, and lay a well-bleached cloak 
And tunic in it ; set upon the fire 
A brazen caldron for our guest, to warm s^ 

The water of his bath, that having bathed 
And viewed the gifts which the Phaeacian chiefs 
Have brought him, ranged in order, he may sit 
Delighted at the banquet and enjoy 
The music. I will give this beautiful cup s=s 

Of gold, that he, in memory of me, 
May daily in his palace pour to Jove 
Libations, and to all the other gods." 

He spake ; Arete bade her maidens haste 
To place an ample tripod on the fire. 530 

Forthwith upon the blazing fire they set 
A laver with three feet, and in it poured 
Water, and heaped fresh fuel on the flames. 
The flames crept up the vessel's swelling sides, 
And warmed the water. Meantime from her room 535 
Arete brought a beautiful chest, in which 
She laid the presents destined for her guest, — 
Garments and gold which the Phaeacians gave, — 
And laid the cloak and tunic with the rest, 
And thus in winged words addressed the chief: — 54a 

" Look to the lid thyself, and cast a cord 
Around it, lest, upon thy voyage home, 
vol. 1. 8 



170 The Odyssey. 

Thou suffer loss, when haply thou shalt take 
A pleasant slumber in the dark-hulled ship." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, heard, and straight 54* 
He fitted to its place the lid, and wound 
And knotted artfully around the chest 
A cord, as queenly Circe long before 
Had taught him. Then to call him to the bath 
The housewife of the palace came. He saw 550 
Gladly the steaming laver, for not oft 
Had he been cared for thus, since he had left 
The dwelling of the nymph with amber hair, 
Calypso, though attended while with her 
As if he were a god. Now when the maids sss 

Had seen him bathed, and had anointed him 
With oil, and put his sumptuous mantle on, 
And tunic, forth he issued from the bath, 
And came to those who sat before their wine. 
Nausicaa, goddess-like in beauty, stood s&> 

Beside a pillar of that noble roof, 
And looking on Ulysses as he passed, 
Admired, and said to him in winged words : — 

" Stranger, farewell, and in thy native land 
Remember thou hast owed thy life to me." 56s 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answering said : — 
" Nausicaa, daughter of the large-souled king 
Alcinoiis ! so may Jove, the Thunderer, 
Husband of Juno, grant that I behold 
My home, returning safe, as I will make 57* 

To thee as to a goddess day by day 



Book VIII. 171 

My prayer ; for, lady, thou hast saved my life." 

He spake, and near Alcinoiis took his place 
Upon a throne. And now they served the feast 
To each, and mingled wine. A herald led 573 

Thither the gentle bard Demodocus, 
Whom all the people honored. Him they placed 
Amidst the assembly, where he leaned against 
A lofty column. Sage Ulysses then 
Carved from the broad loin of a white-tusked boar 560 
A part, where yet a mass of flesh remained 
Bordered with fat, and to the herald said : — 

" Bear this, O herald, to Demodocus, 
That he may eat. Him, even in my grief, 
Will I embrace, for worthily the bards 58s 

Are honored and revered o'er all the earth 
By every race of men. The Muse herself 
Hath taught them song; she loves the minstrel tribe." 

He spake ; the herald laid the flesh before 
Demodocus the hero, who received 590 

The gift well pleased. Then all the guests put forth 
Their hands and shared the viands on the board ; 
And when their thirst and hunger were allayed, 
Thus to the minstrel sage Ulysses spake : — 

" Demodocus, above all other men 59s 

I give thee praise, for either has the Muse, 
Jove's daughter, or Apollo, visited 
And taught thee. Truly hast thou sung the fate 
Of the Achaian warriors, — what they did 
And suffered, — all their labors as if thou 600 



172 The Odyssey. 

Hadst been among them, or hadst heard the tale 

From an eye-witness. Now, I pray, proceed, 

And sing the invention of the wooden horse 

Made by Epeius with Minerva's aid, 

And by the chief Ulysses artfully 60s 

Conveyed into the Trojan citadel, 

With armed warriors in its womb to lay 

The city waste. And I, if thou relate 

The story rightly, will at once declare 

To all that largely hath some bounteous god e» 

Bestowed on thee the holy gift of song." 

He spake ; the poet felt the inspiring god, 
And sang, beginning where the Argives hurled 
Firebrands among their tents, and sailed away 
In their good galleys, save the band that sat *s 
Beside renowned Ulysses in the horse, 
Concealed from sight, amid the Trojan crowd, 
Who now had drawn it to the citadel. 
So there it stood, while, sitting round it, talked 
The men of Troy, and wist not what to do. 620 

By turns three counsels pleased them, — to hew down 
The hollow trunk with the remorseless steel ; 
Or drag it to a height, and cast it thence 
Headlong among the rocks j or, lastly, leave 
The enormous image standing and unharmed, 625 
An offering to appease the gods. And this 
At last was done ; for so had fate decreed 
That they should be destroyed whene'er their town 
Should hold within its walls the horse of wood, 



Book VIII 173 

In which the mightiest of the Argives came 630 

Among the sons of Troy to smite and slay. 
Then sang the bard how, issuing from the womb 
Of that deceitful horse, the sons of Greece 
Laid Ilium waste ; how each in different ways 
Ravaged the town, while, terrible as Mars, 635 

Ulysses, joined with Menelaus, sought 
The palace of Deiphobus, and there 
Maintained a desperate battle, till the aid 
Of mighty Pallas made the victory his. 

So sang renowned Demodocus ; the strain 640 
Melted to tears Ulysses, from whose lids 
They dropped and wet his cheeks. As when a wife 
Weeps her beloved husband, slain before 
His town and people, fighting to defend 
Them and his own dear babes from deadly harm, 6 45 
She sees him gasp and die, and at the sight 
She falls with piercing cries upon his corpse, 
Meantime the victors beat her on the back 
And shoulders with their spears, and bear her off 
To toil and grieve in slavery, where her cheeks 650 
In that long bitter sorrow lose their bloom ; 
So from the eyelids of Ulysses fell 
The tears, yet fell unnoticed by them all 
Save that Alcinoiis, sitting at his side, 
Saw them, and heard his heavy sighs, and thus 6 53 
Bespake his people, masters of the oar : — 

" Princes and chiefs of the Phaeacian race, 
Give ear. Let now Demodocus lay by 



174 The Odyssey. 

His clear-toned harp. The matter of his song 

Delights not all alike. Since first we sat 660 

At meat, and since our noble bard began 

His lay, our guest has never ceased to grieve ; 

Some mighty sorrow weighs upon his heart. 

Now let the bard refrain, that we may all 

Enjoy the banquet, both our guest and we 66s 

Who welcome him, for it is fitting thus. 

And now are all things for our worthy guest 

Made ready, both the escort and these gifts, 

The pledges of our kind regard. A guest, 

A suppliant, is a brother, even to him 670 

Who bears a heart not easy to be moved. 

No longer, then, keep back with studied art 

What I shall ask ; 't were better far to speak 

With freedom. Tell the name thy mother gave, 

Thy father, and all those who dwell within, 675 

And round thy city. For no living man 

Is nameless from the time that he is born. 

Humble or high in station, at their birth 

The parents give them names. Declare thy land, 

Thy people, and thy city, that our ships 680 

May learn, and bear thee to the place ; for here 

In our Phaeacian ships no pilots are, 

Nor rudders, as in ships of other lands. 

Ours know the thoughts and the intents of men. 

To them all cities and all fertile coasts 6"s 

Inhabited by men are known ; they cross 

The great sea scudding fast, involved in mist 



Book VII L 175 

And darkness, with no fear of perishing 

Or meeting harm. I heard Nausithous, 

My father, say that Neptune was displeased &*> 

With us for safely bearing to their homes 

So many men, and that he would destroy 

In after time some good Phseacian ship, 

Returning from a convoy, in the waves 

Of the dark sea, and leave her planted there, 69? 

A mountain huge and high, before our town. 

So did the aged chieftain prophesy ; 

The god, as best may please him, will fulfil 

My father's words, or leave them unfulfilled. 

Now tell me truly whither thou hast roamed, 700 

And what the tribes of men that thou hast seen ; 

Tell which of them are savage, rude, unjust, 

And which are hospitable and revere 

The blessed gods. Declare why thou didst weep 

And sigh when hearing what unhappy fate 70s 

Befell the Argive and Achaian host 

And town of Troy. The gods decreed it ; they 

Ordain destruction to the sons of men, 

A theme of song thereafter. Hadst thou not 

Some valiant kinsman who was slain at Troy? 7™ 

A son-in-law ? the father of thy wife ? 

Nearest of all are they to us, save those 

Of our own blood. Or haply might it be 

Some bosom-friend, one eminently graced 

With all that wins our love ; for not less dear 7*5 

Than if he were a brother should we hold 

The wise and gentle man who is our friend."
