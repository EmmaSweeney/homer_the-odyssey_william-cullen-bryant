NOW from the fair broad boscm of the sea 
Into the brazen vault of heaven the sun 
Rose shining for the immortals and for men 
Upon the foodful earth. The voyagers 
Arrived at Pylos, nobly built, the town 5 

Of Neleus. There, upon the ocean-side, 
They found the people offering coal-black steers 
To dark-haired Neptune. On nine seats they sat, 
Five hundred on each seat ; nine steers were slain 



40 The Odyssey. 

For each five hundred there. While they performed 
The rite, and, tasting first the entrails, burned » 
The thighs to ocean's god, the Ithacans 
Touched land, and, lifting up the good ship's sail, 
Furled it and moored the keel, and then stepped out 
Upon the shore. Forth from the galley came 15 
Telemachus, the goddess guiding him, 
And thus to him the blue-eyed Pallas said : — 

" Telemachus, there now is no excuse, 
Not even the least, for shamefaced backwardness. 
Thou hast come hither o'er the deep to ask 20 

For tidings of thy father, — what far land 
Conceals him, what the fate that he has met. 
Go then at once to Nestor, the renowned 
In horsemanship, and we shall see what plan 
He hath in mind for thee. Entreat him there 25 
That frankly he declare it. He will speak 
No word of falsehood ; he is truly wise." 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : — 
" O Mentor, how shall I approach the chief, 
And with what salutation ? Little skill 30 

Have I in courtly phrase, and shame becomes 
A youth in questioning an aged man." 

Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, spake again : — 
" In part thy mind will prompt thy speech ; in part 
A god will put the words into thy mouth, — 35 

For well I deem that thou wert neither born 
Nor trained without the favor of the gods." 

Thus having said, the blue-eyed Pallas moved 



Book III. 41 

With hasty pace before, and in her steps 

He followed close, until they reached the seats ^ 

Of those assembled Pylians. Nestor there 

Sat with his sons, while his companions stood 

Around him and prepared the feast, and some 

Roasted the flesh at fires, and some transfixed 

The parts with spits. As they beheld the approach 4s 

Of strangers they advanced, and took their hands, 

And bade them sit. Pisistratus, a son 

Of Nestor, came the first of all, and took 

A hand of each, and placed them at the feast 

On the soft hides that o'er the ocean sand 5° 

Were spread beside his brother Thrasymed 

And his own father ; brought for their repast 

Parts of the entrails, poured for them the wine 

Into a golden goblet, held it forth 

In his right hand, and with these words bespake ss 

Pallas, the child of aegis-bearing Jove : — 

" Pray, stranger, to King Neptune. Ye have 
chanced 
Upon his feast in coming to our coast. 
And after thy libation poured, and prayer 
Made to the god, give over to thy friend &> 

The goblet of choice wine that he may make 
Libation also ; he, I question not, 
Prays to the gods ; we all have need of them, 
A younger man is he than thou, and seems 
In age to be my equal ; therefore I 63 

Will give the golden goblet first to thee." 



42 The Odyssey. 

He spake, and in the hands of Pallas placed 
The goblet of choice wine. Well pleased was she 
With one so just and so discreet, — well pleased 
That first to her he reached the cup of gold, *, 

And thus she prayed to Neptune fervently : — 

"Hear, Neptune, thou who dost embrace the 
earth, 
And of thy grace disdain not to bestow 
These blessings on thy suppliants. First of all 
Vouchsafe to Nestor and his sons increase n 

Of glory ; on the Pylian people next 
Bestow, for this most sumptuous hecatomb, 
Large recompense ; and, lastly, grant to us — 
Telemachus and me — a safe return 
To our own country with the end attained so 

Which brought us hither in our gallant bark." 

Thus did she pray, while she fulfilled the prayer j 
And then she handed to Telemachus 
The fair round goblet, and in words like hers 
The dear son of Ulysses prayed. Meanwhile s s 
The Pylians, having roasted well the flesh 
And drawn it from the spits, distributing 
To each his portion, held high festival. 
And when the calls of hunger and of thirst 
Were silenced, Nestor, the Gerenian knight, 9c 

Began discourse, and thus bespake his guests : — 

" The fitting time is come to ask our guests 
Who they may be, since now their feast is o'er. 
Say then, O strangers, who ye are, and whence 



Book III. 43 

Ye come along the pathway of the deep. 95 

Have ye an errand here, or do ye roam 
The seas at large, like pirates, braving death, 
And visiting with ravage foreign states ? " 

And then discreet Telemachus replied 
Boldly, — for Pallas strengthened in that hour *» 
His heart that he might confidently ask 
News of his absent father, and so win 
A worthy fame among the sons of men : — 

" O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece ! 
Thou bid'st us tell thee whence we came, and I 103 
Will faithfully declare it. We are come 
From Ithaca, beneath the Neritus, 
And private, and not general, is the cause 
Of which I am to speak. I came to ask 
Concerning my great father, the large -soul ed in 
And nobly-born Ulysses, who 't is said 
With thee, his friend in arms, laid waste the town 
Of Ilium. We have heard where all the rest 
Who warred against the Trojans were cut off, 
And died sad deaths ; his fate alone the son "s 
Of Saturn hath not chosen to reveal, — 
Whether he fell on land by hostile hands, 
Or while at sea was whelmed beneath the waves 
Of Amphitrite. Wherefore to thy knees 
I come, to ask that thou — if so thou wilt — **> 
Relate the manner of his mournful death, 
As thou didst see it with thine eyes, or else 
As thou from other wanderers hast heard 



44 The Odyssey. 

Its history ; for she who brought him forth 

Bore him to be unhappy. Think thou not «5 

To soften aught, through tenderness to me, 

In thy recital, but in faithful words 

Tell me the whole, whatever thou hast seen. 

And I conjure thee, that if, in his life, 

My father, great Ulysses, ever gave 130 

Promise of word or deed for thee, and kept 

His promise, in the realm of Troy, where ye 

Achaians bore such hardships, that thou now 

Remember it and speak without disguise." 

And Nestor the Gerenian knight replied : — 13s 
" My friend, since thou recallest to my mind 
The sufferings borne by us the sons of Greece, 
Although of peerless valor, in that land, 
Both when we ranged in ships the darkling sea 
For booty wheresoe'er Achilles led, no 

And when around King Priam's populous town 
We fought, where fell our bravest, know thou then 
That there the valiant Ajax lies, and there 
Achilles ; there Patroclus, like the gods 
In council ; there my well-beloved son us 

Blameless and brave, Antilochus the swift 
Of foot and warlike, — many woes beside 
We bore, and who of mortal birth could give 
Their history ? Nay, though thou shouldst remain 
Five years or six, and ask of all the griefs w 

Endured by the brave Greeks, thou wouldst deparr 
Outwearied to thy home, ere thou hadst heard 



Book HI. 45 

The whole. Nine years in harassing the foe 

We passed, beleaguering them and planning wiles 

Innumerable. Saturn's son at last 15s 

With difficulty seemed to close the war. 

Then was there none who might presume to vie 

In wisdom with Ulysses ; that great man 

Excelled in every kind of stratagem, — 

Thy father, — if indeed thou be his son. *» 

I look on thee amazed ; all thy discourse 

Is just like his, and one would ne'er believe 

A younger man could speak so much like him. 

While we were there, Ulysses and myself 

In council or assembly never spake *s 

On different sides, but with a like intent 

We thoughtfully consulted how to guide 

The Achaians in the way we deemed the best ; 

But after we had overthrown and spoiled 

King Priam's lofty city, and set sail 170 

For home, and by some heavenly power the Greeks 

Were scattered, Jupiter ordained for them 

A sad return. For all were neither wise 

Nor just, and many drew upon themselves 

An evil doom, — the fatal wrath of her, 175 

The blue-eyed maid, who claims her birth from Jove. 

'T was she who kindled strife between the sons 

Of Atreus. They had called the Achaians all 

To an assembly, not with due regard 

To order, at the setting of the sun, iao 

And thither came the warriors overpowered 



46 The Odyssey. 

With wine. The brother kings set forth the cause 

Of that assembly. Menelaus first 

Bade all the Greeks prepare for their return 

O'er the great deep. That counsel little pleased 185 

King Agamemnon, who desired to keep 

The people longer there, that he might soothe 

By sacred hecatombs the fiery wrath 

Of Pallas. Fool ! who could not see how vain 

Were such persuasion, for the eternal gods 100 

Are not soon won to change their purposes. 

They stood disputing thus, with bitter words, 

Till wrangling noisily on different sides 

Rose up the well-armed Greeks. The ensuing night 

We rested, but we cherished in our breasts 195 

A mutual hate ; so for our punishment 

Had Jove ordained. With early morn we drew 

Our ships to the great deep, and put our goods 

And our deep-bosomed women all on board. 

Yet half the host went not, but on the shore *» 

Remained with Agamemnon, Atreus' son, 

And shepherd of the people. All the rest 

Embarked, weighed anchor, and sailed swiftly 

thence ; 
A deity made smooth the mighty deep, 
And when we came to Tenedos we paid 205 

Our offerings to the gods and longed for home — 
Vainly ; it pleased not unpropitious Jove 
To favor our return, and once again 
He sent among us strife. A part of us 



Book III. 47 

Led by Ulysses, that sagacious prince, ™ 

To please Atrides Agamemnon turned 

Their well-oared galleys back. But I, with all 

The vessels of the fleet that followed me, 

Fled on my way, perceiving that some god 

Was meditating evil. With us fled, aij 

Encouraging his men, the warlike son 

Of Tydeus. Fair-haired Menelaus came 

Later to us in Lesbos, where we planned 

For a long voyage, whether we should sail 

Around the rugged Chios, toward the isle -»o 

Of Psyria, keeping that upon the left, 

Or under Chios pass beside the steeps 

Of windy Mimas. We besought the god 

That he would show a sign, and he complied, 

And bade us to Eubcea cross the deep 225 

Right in the midst, the sooner to escape 

All danger. Then the wind blew strong and shrill, 

And swiftly o'er the fishy gulfs our fleet 

Flew on, and reached Geraestus in the night. 

There, having passed the mighty deep, we made 230 

To Neptune offerings of many a thigh 

Of beeves. The fourth day dawned, and now the 

men 
Of Diomed, the mighty horseman, son 
Of Tydeus. stopped at Argos with their fleet, 
While I went on to Pylos with the wind, -35 

Which never, from the moment that the god , 
First sent it o'er the waters, ceased to blow. 



48 The Odyssey. 

" So, my dear child, I reached my home, nor knew 
Nor heard from others who among the Greeks 
Was saved, or who had perished on the way. -ao 
Yet what I since have heard while here I sit 
Within my palace thou shalt duly learn. 
Nor is it what I ought to keep from thee. 

" 'T is said the Myrmidonian spearmen, led 
By great Achilles' famous son, returned 24s 

Happily home ; as happily the son 
Of Paeas, Philoctetes the renowned. 
Idomeneus brought also back to Crete 
All his companions who survived the war ; 
The sea took none of them. But ye have heard, 250 
Though far away, the fate of Atreus' son, — 
How he came home, and how ^Egisthus laid 
A plot to slay him, yet on his own head 
Drew heavy punishment, — so fortunate 
It is when he who falls by murder leaves 25: 

A son ; for 't was the monarch's son who took 
Vengeance upon the crafty murderer 
yEgisthus, by whose hand Atrides died. 
Thou too, my friend, for thou art large of frame, 
And of a noble presence, be thou brave, ^ 

That men in time to come may give thee praise." 

Then spake discreet Telemachus again : — 
li O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece, 
Ample was his revenge, and far and wide 
The Greeks will spread his fame to be the song »es 
Of future times. O might the gods confer 



Book III. 49 

On me an equal power to avenge myself 

On that importunate, overbearing crew 

Of suitors, who insult me, and devise 

Evil against me ! But the gods deny *i« 

Such fortune to my father and to me, 

And all that now is left me is to bear." 

Again spake Nestor the Gerenian knight: — 
" Since thou, my friend, hast spoken words which 

bring 
What I have heard to mind, — the rumor goes 375 
That in thy palace many suiters wait 
About thy mother, and in spite of thee 
Do grievous wrong. Now tell me ; dost thou yield 
Willingly, or because the people, swayed 
By oracles, regard thee as their foe ? 280 

Thy father yet may come again, — who knows ? — 
Alone, or with the other Greeks, to take 
The vengeance which these violent deeds deserve, 
Should blue-eyed Pallas deign to favor thee, 
As once she watched to guard the glorious chief 285 
Ulysses in the realm of Troy, where we, 
The Achaians, bore such hardships, — for I ne'er 
Have seen the gods so openly befriend 
A man as Pallas there befriended him, — 
Should she thus deign to favor thee and keep 29c 
Watch over thee, then haply some of these 
Will never think of marriage rites again." 

Then spake discreet Telemachus again : — 
u O aged man ! I cannot think thy words 

vol. 1. 3 D 



50 The Odyssey. 

Will be fulfilled ! for they import too much 29s 

And they amaze me. What thou sayst I wish 
May come to pass, but know it cannot be, 
Not even though i.he gods should will it so." 

Then thus the blue-eyed goddess, Pallas, spake : — 
"Telemachus, what words have passed thy lips? 300 
Easily can a god, whene'er he will, 
In the most distant regions safely keep 
A man ; and I would rather reach my home 
Securely, after many hardships borne, 
Than perish suddenly on my return 305 

As Agamemnon perished by the guile 
Of base ^Egisthus and the queen. And yet 
The gods themselves have not the power to save 
Whom most they cherish from the common doom 
When cruel fate brings on the last long sleep." 3™ 

Discreet Telemachus made answer thus : — 
" Let us, O Mentor, talk no more of this, 
Though much we grieve ; he never will return, 
For his is the black doom of death ordained 
By the great gods. Now suffer me to ask 315 

Of Nestor further, since to him are known, 
Beyond all other men, the rules of right 
And prudence. He has governed, so men say, 
Three generations, and to me he seems 
In aspect like the ever-living gods. 328 

O Nestor, son of Neleus, truly say 
How died the monarch over mighty realms, 
Atrides Agamemnon ? Where was then 



Book IIL 51 

His brother Menelaus ? By what arts 

Did treacherous iEgisthus plan his death, sa 

And slay a braver warrior than himself? 

Was not the brother in the Achaian town 

Of Argos ? or was he a wanderer 

In other lands, which made the murderer bold?" 

The knight, Gerenian Nestor, answered thus : — 3:1 
" I will tell all and truly. Thou hast guessed 
Rightly and as it happened. Had the son 
Of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaus, come 
From Troy, and found ^Egisthus yet alive 
Within the palace, he had never flung 33S 

The loose earth on his corpse, but dogs and birds 
Had preyed upon it, lying in the fields 
Far from the city, and no woman's voice 
Of all the Greeks had raised the wail for him. 
Great was the crime he plotted. We were yet 34- 
Afar, enduring the hard toils of war, 
While he, securely couched in his retreat 
At Argos, famed for steeds, with flattering words 
Corrupted Agamemnon's queen. At first 
The noble Clytemnestra turned away ■* 

With horror from the crime ; for yet her heart 
Was right, and by her side there stood a bard 
With whom Atrides, when he went to Troy, 
Had left his wife with many an earnest charge. 
But when the gods and fate had spread a net "■ 

For his destruction, then ^Egisthus bore 
The minstrel to a desert isle, and there 



52 The Odyssey. 

Left him to be devoured by birds of prey, 

And led the queen, as willing as himself, 

To his own palace. Many a victim's thigh *>s 

Upon the hallowed altars of the gods 

He offered, many a gift of ornaments 

Woven or wrought in gold he hung within 

Their temples, since at length the mighty end 

For which he hardly dared to hope was gained. *» 

We sailed together from the coast of Troy, 

Atrides, Menelaus, and myself, 

Friends to each other. When the headland height 

Of Athens, hallowed Sunium, met our eyes, 

Apollo smote with his still shafts, and slew 36s 

Phrontis, Onetor's son, who steered the bark 

Of Menelaus, holding in his hands 

The rudder as the galley scudded on, — 

And skilled was he beyond all other men 

To guide a vessel when the storm was high. 370 

So there did Menelaus stay his course, 

Though eager to go on, that he might lay 

His friend in earth and pay the funeral rites. 

But setting sail again with all his fleet 

Upon the dark-blue sea, all-seeing Jove 37s 

Decreed a perilous voyage. He sent forth 

His shrill-voiced hurricane, and heaped on high 

The mountain waves. There, scattering the barks 

Far from each other, part he drove to Crete, 

Where the Cydonians dwell, beside the stream 38 

Of Jardanus. A smooth and pointed rock 



Book III. 53 

Just on the bounds of Gortys stands amidst 
The dark-blue deep. The south wind thitherward 
Sweeps a great sea towards Phcestus, and against 
The headland on the left, where that small rock 38s 
Meets and withstands the mighty wave. The ships 
Were driven on this, and scarce the crews escaped 
With life j the ships were dashed against the crags 
And wrecked, save five, and these, with their black 

prows, 
Were swept toward Egypt by the winds and 

waves. 390 

" Thus adding to his wealth and gathering gold 
He roamed the ocean in his ships among 
Men of strange speech. ^Egisthus meantime 

planned 
His guilty deeds at home ; he slew the king 
Atrides, and the people took his yoke. -»s 

Seven years in rich Mycenae he bore rule, 
And on the eighth, to his destruction, came 
The nobly-born Orestes, just returned 
From Athens, and cut off that man of blood, 
The crafty wretch yEgisthus, by whose hand *» 
Fell his illustrious father. Then he bade 
The Argives to the solemn burial-feast 
Of his bad mother and the craven wretch 
^Egisthus. Menelaus, that same day, 
The great in war, arrived, and brought large 

wealth — 40! 

So large his galleys could contain no more. 



54 The Odyssey. 

" And thou, my friend, be thou not long away, 
Wandering from home, thy rich possessions left, 
And in thy palace-halls a lawless crew, 
Lest they devour thy substance, and divide *• 

Thy goods, and thou have crossed the sea in vain. 
Yet must I counsel and enjoin on thee 
To visit Menelaus, who has come 
Just now from lands and nations of strange men, 
Whence one could hardly hope for a return ; «is 
Whom once the tempest's violence had driven 
Into that great wide sea o'er which the birds 
Of heaven could scarce fly hither in a year, 
Such is its fearful vastness. Go thou now, 
Thou with thy ship and friends ; or if thou choose 4*> 
The way by land, a car and steeds are here, 
And here my sons to guide thee to the town 
Of hallowed Lacedaemon, there to find 
The fair-haired Menelaus. Earnestly 
Beseech of him that he declare the truth. 425 

Falsely he will not speak, for he is wise." 

He spake ; the sun went down ; the darkness crept 
Over the earth, and blue-eyed Pallas said : — 
" Most wisely hast thou spoken, ancient man. 
Now cut ye out the tongues, and mingle wine, 439 
That we to Neptune and the other gods 
May pour libations, and then think of rest ; 
For now the hour is come ; the light is gone, 
Nor at a feast in honor of the gods 
Should we long sit, but in good time withdraw." 43s 



Book III 55 

Jove's daughter spake; they hearkened to her 
words ; 
The heralds came to them, and on their hands 
Poured water ; boys began to fill the bowls 
To the hard brim, and ministered to each 
From left to right. Then threw they to the flames 440 
The victims' tongues, and, rising, poured on earth 
Wine to the gods ; and when that rite was paid, 
And when their thirst was satiate, Pallas rose 
With nobly-born Telemachus to go 
To their good ship, but Nestor still detained 445 
The twain, and chidingly bespake them thus: — 

" Now Jove and all the other gods forbid 
That ye should go from me to your good ship, 
As from some half-clad wretch, too poor to own 
Mantles and blankets in whose soft warm folds 450 
He and his guests might sleep ; but I have both — 
Mantles and blankets — beautifully wrought, 
And never shall the son of that great man 
Ulysses lie upon a galley's deck 
While I am living. After me I hope 455 

My sons, who dwell within my palace-halls, 
Will duly welcome all who enter here." 

And thus again the blue-eyed Pallas spake : — 
" Well hast thou said, my aged friend, and well 
Doth it become Telemachus to heed 460 

Thy words, for that were best. Let him remain 
With thee and sleep in thine abode, while I 
Repair to our black ship, encouraging 



56 The Odyssey. 

The crew, and setting them their proper tasks, 

For I am eldest of them all ; the rest 46s 

Are young men yet, and moved by friendship joined 

Our enterprise ; the peers in age are they 

Of the large-souled Telemachus. To-night 

I sleep within the hull of our black ship, 

And sail with early morning for the land 4t» 

Of the Cauconians, large of soul, from whom 

A debt is due me, neither new nor small. 

Send meantime from thy palace in a car, 

And with thy son, this youth, and be the steeds 

The fleetest and the strongest in thy stalls." ,n 

The blue-eyed Pallas, having spoken thus, 
Passed like an eagle out of sight, and all 
Were seized with deep amazement as they saw. 
The aged monarch, wondering at the sight, 
Took by the hand Telemachus, and said : — 480 

" Of craven temper, and unapt for war, 
O friend, thou canst not be, since thus the gods 
Attend and guide thee in thy youth. And this, 
Of all the gods whose dwelling is in heaven, 
Can be no other than the spoiler-queen 435 

Pallas, the child of Jove, who also held 
Thy father in such eminent esteem 
Among the Grecians. Deign to favor us, 
O queen ! bestow on me and on my sons 
And on my venerable spouse the meed 490 

Of special glory. I will bring to thee 
A sacrifice, a broad- horned yearling steer, 



Book III. 57 

Which never man hath tamed or led beneath 
The yoke. Her will I bring with gilded horns, 
And lay an offering on thine altar-fires." 49s 

Such were his words, and Pallas heard the prayer, 
And then Gerenian Nestor led the way, 
And with his sons and sons-in-law approached 
His glorious palace. When they came within 
The monarch's sumptuous halls, each took his 
place 500 

In order on the couches and the thrones. 
The old man mingled for them as they came 
A bowl of delicate wine, eleven years old, 
Drawn by the damsel cupbearer, who took 
Its cover from the jar. The aged chief 50s 

Mingled it in the bowl, and, pouring out 
A part to Pallas, offered earnest prayer 
To her, who sprang from aegis-bearing Jove. 

When due libations had been made, and all 
Drank till they wished no more, most went away, s« 
Each to his home to sleep ; but Nestor made 
Telemachus, the son of the great chief 
Ulysses, rest upon a sumptuous couch 
Within the echoing hall, and near to him 
The chief of squadrons, skilled to wield the spear, 51s 
Peisistratus, who only of his sons 
Abode in Nestor's halls unwedded yet ; 
While in an inner room of that tall pile 
The monarch slumbered on a bed of state, 
Decked for him by the labors of his queen. s» 

3* 



58 The Odyssey. 

Soon as the daughter of the dawn appeared, 
The rosy-fingered Morning, Nestor left 
His bed and went abroad, and took his seat 
On smooth white stones before his lofty doors, 
That glistened as with oil, on which before 52s 

Sat Neleus, wise in council as the gods. 
But he had yielded to the will of fate, 
And passed into the Underworld. Now sat 
Gerenian Nestor in his father's place, 
The guardian of the Greeks. Around his seat, 530 
Just from the chambers of their rest, his sons 
Echephron, Stratius, and Aretus came, 
Perseus, and Thrasymedes ; after these 
Came brave Peisistratus, the sixth and last. 
They led Telemachus, the godlike youth, 535 

And placed him near them. The Gerenian knight 
Nestor began, and thus bespake his sons : — 

" Do quickly what I ask, dear sons, and aid 
To render Pallas, first of all the gods, 
Propitious, — Pallas, who has deigned to come, 54c 
And at a solemn feast to manifest 
Herself to me. Let one of you go forth 
Among the fields, and bring a heifer thence, 
Led by the herdsman. To the dark-hulled ship 
Of the large-souled Telemachus I bid 54s 

Another son repair, and bring the crew 
Save only two ; and let another call 
Laerceus hither, skilled to work in gold, 
That he may plate with gold the heifer's horns. 



Book III. 59 

Let all the rest remain to bid the maids 550 

Within prepare a sumptuous feast, and bring 
Seats, wood, and limpid water from the fount." 

He spake, and all were busy. From the field 
The bullock came ; from the swift-sailing bark 
Came the companions of the gallant youth 555 

Telemachus ; with all his implements — 
Hammer and anvil, and well-jointed tongs — 
With which he wrought, the goldsmith also came, 
And to be present at the sacred rites 
Pallas came likewise. Nestor, aged knight, & 

Brought forth the gold ; the artisan prepared 
The metal, and about the bullock's horns 
Wound it, that Pallas might with pleasure see 
The victim so adorned. Then Stratius grasped 
The horns, and, aided by Echephron, led 56s 

The bullock. From his room Aretus brought 
A laver filled with water in one hand, 
And in the other hand a canister 
Of cakes, while Thrasymedes, great in war, 
Stood near with a sharp axe, about to smite 570 

The victim. Perseus held a vase to catch 
The blood, while Nestor, aged horseman, took 
Water and cakes, and offering first a part, 
And flinging the shorn forelock to the flames, 
Prayed to the goddess Pallas fervently. 57s 

And now, when they had prayed, and flung the 
cakes, 
The large-souled Thrasymedes, Nestor's son,

Struck, where he stood, the blow ; the bullock's 

strength 
Gave way. At once the daughters of the king, 
And his sons' wives, and queen Eurydice, — 580 
Nestor's chaste wife, and daughter eldest born 
Of Clymenus, broke forth in shrilly cries. 
From the great earth the sons then lifted up 
And held the victim's head. Peisistratus, 
The chief of squadrons, slew it. When the 

blood 535 

Had ceased to flow, and life had left its limbs, 
They quickly severed joint from joint ; they hewed 
The thighs away, and duly covered them 
With caul, a double fold, on which they laid 
Raw strips of flesh. The aged monarch burned 590 
These over the cleft wood, and poured dark wine 
Upon them, while beside him stood the youths 
With five-pronged spits j and when the thighs were 

burned 
And entrails tasted, all the rest they carved 
Into small portions and transfixed with spits, 59s 
And roasted, holding the sharp spits in hand. 
Meantime, fair Polycaste, youngest born 
Of Nestor's daughters, gave Telemachus 
The bath ; and after he had bathed she shed 
A rich oil over him, and in a cloak *» 

Of noble texture and a tunic robed 
The prince, who, like a god in presence, left 
The bath, and took his place where Nestor sat, 



Book III. 6 1 

The shepherd of the people. When the youths 
Had roasted well and from the spits with- 
drawn 60s 
The flesh, they took their places at the feast. 
Then rose up chosen men, and poured the wine 
Into the cups of gold ; and when at length 
The thirst and appetite were both allayed, 
The knight, Gerenian Nestor, thus began : — 610 
" Rise now, my sons ; join to the bright-haired 
steeds 
My car, and let Telemachus depart." 

He spake ; they hearkened and obeyed, and 
straight 
Yoked the swift horses to the car. Then came 
The matron of the household, laying bread 615 

And wine within the car, and dainties such 
As make a prince's fare. Telemachus 
Then climbed into the sumptuous seat. The son 
Of Nestor and the chief of armed bands, 
Peisistratus, climbed also, took his place &™ 

Beside him, grasped the reins, and with the lash 
Urged on the coursers. Not unwillingly 
They darted toward the plain, and left behind 
The lofty Pylos. All that day they shook 
The yoke on both their necks. The sun went 
down ; 62s 

The highways lay in darkness when they came 
To Pherae and the abode of Diodes, 
Son of Orsilochus, who claimed to be 



62 The Odyssey. 

The offspring of Alpheius. They with him 
Found welcome there, and there that night they 
slept. 630 

And when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared, 
They yoked the horses, climbed the shining car, 
And issued from the palace gate beneath 
The sounding portico. Peisistratus 
AVielded the lash to urge the coursers on, 6 35 

And not unwillingly they flew and reached 
A land of harvests. Here the travellers found 
Their journey's end, so swiftly those fleet steeds 
Had borne them on. And now the sun went 

down, 
And darkness gathered over all the ways.
