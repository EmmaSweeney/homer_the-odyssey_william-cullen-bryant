THEY came to Lacedaemon's valley, seamed 
With dells, and to the palace of its king, 
The glorious Menelaus, whom they found 
Within, and at a wedding banquet, made 
Both for his blameless daughter and his son, 
And many guests. Her he must send away, 
Bride of the son of that invincible chief, 
Achilles. He betrothed her while in Troy, 
And gave his kingly word, and now the gods 
Fulfilled it by the marriage. He was now 



Book IV. 63 

Sending her forth, with steeds and cars, to reach 

The noble city of the Myrmidons, 

Where ruled her consort. From the Spartan coast 

He brought Alector's daughter for his son, 

The gallant Megapenthes, borne to him 15 

By a handmaiden in his later years. 

For not to Helen had the gods vouchsafed 

Yet other offspring, after she had brought 

A lovely daughter forth, Hermione, 

Like golden Venus both in face and form. 20 

So banqueting the neighbors and the friends 
Of glorious Menelaus sat beneath 
The lofty ceiling of those spacious halls, 
Delighted with the feast. A sacred bard 
Amidst them touched the harp and sang to them 2* 
While, as the song began, two dancers sprang 
Into the midst and trod the measure there 

But they — the hero-youth Telemachus 
And Nestor's eminent son — were at the gate, 
And standing in the entrance with their steeds. 30 
The worthy Eteoneus, coming forth, — 
The trusty servant of the glorious son 
Of Atreus, — saw, and hastening thence to tell 
The shepherd of the people, through the hall 
He came to him, and spake these winged words : — 35 

" O Menelaus, foster-child of Jove, 
Two strangers have arrived, two men who seem 
Descended from almighty Jupiter. 
Shall we then loose the harness from their steeds, 



64 The Odyssey. 

Or bid them elsewhere seek a friendly host ? " 40 

The fair-haired king indignantly replied : - — 
" Nay, Eteoneus, thou hast not been wont 
Son of Boethus, thus to play the fool. 
Thou pratest idly, like a child. Ourselves 
Have sat, as guests, at generous banquets given *s 
By other men, when journeying hitherward 
In hope that Jove might grant a respite here 
From our disasters. Hasten, then, to loose 
The steeds, and bring the strangers to the feast." 
He spake ; the attendant hastened forth and 
called 50 

The other trusty servitors, with charge 
To follow. They unyoked the sweaty steeds, 
And bound them to the stalls, and gave them oats, 
With which they mingled the white barley-grains, 
And close against the shining wall they placed 55 
The car, and then they led the guests within 
The sumptuous palace. Entering, these admired 
The palace of the foster-child of Jove, 
For like the splendor of the sun and moon 
Its glory was. They with delighted eyes 60 

Gazed, and, descending to the polished baths, 
They bathed. The attendant maids who at the bath 
Had ministered, anointing them with oil, 
Arrayed the stranger guests in fleecy cloaks 
And tunics. Each sat down upon a throne 6 s 

Near to Atrides. Now a handmaid brought 
A beautiful ewer of gold, and laver wrought 



Book IV. 65 

Of silver, and poured water for their hands, 
And spread a polished table near their seat ; 
The reverend matron of the household came 70 

With bread, and set before them many a dish 
Gathered from all the feast. The carver next 
Brought chargers lifted high, and in them meats 
Of every flavor, and before them placed 
Beakers of gold. The fair-haired monarch gave 75 
His hand to each, and then bespake them thus : — 

" Now taste our banquet and rejoice, and when 
Ye are refreshed with food we will inquire 
Who ye may be ; for ye are not of those 
Whose race degenerates, ye are surely born &■ 

Of sceptred kings, the favorites of Jove. 
Ignoble men have never sons like you." 

Thus having said, and taking in his hands 
A fatling bullock's chine, which menials brought 
Roasted, and placed beside the king in sign s 5 

Of honor, this he laid before his guests. 
And they put forth their hands and banqueted ; 
And when the calls of hunger and of thirst 
At length were stilled, Telemachus inclined 
His head toward Nestor's son, that no one else 90 
Might listen to his words, and thus he said : — 

" See, son of Nestor, my beloved friend, 
In all these echoing rooms the sheen of brass, 
Of gold, of amber, and of ivory ; 
Such is the palace of Olympian Jove 95 

Within its walls. How many things are here 

E 



66 The Odyssey. 

Of priceless worth ! I wonder as I gaze." 

The fair-haired Menelaus heard him speak, 
And thus accosted both with winged words : — 

" Dear sons, no mortal man may vie with Jove, 100 
Whose palace and possessions never know 
Decay, but other men may vie or not 
In wealth with me. 'T was after suffering 
And wandering long that in my fleet I brought 
My wealth with me, and landed on this coast io S 
In the eighth year. For I had roamed afar 
To Cyprus and to Phoenice, and where 
The Egyptians dwell, and Ethiopia's sons, 
And the Sidonians, and the Erembian race, 
And to the coast of Lybia, where the lambs «* 

Are yeaned with budding horns. There do the ewes 
Thrice in the circle of the year bring forth 
Their young. There both the master of the herd 
And herdsman know no lack of cheese, or flesh, 
Or of sweet milk ; for there the herds yield milk us 
The whole year round. While I was roaming thus, 
And gathering store of wealth, another slew 
My brother, unforewarned, and through the fraud 
Of his own guilty consort. Therefore small 
Is the content I find in bearing rule ^ 

O'er these possessions. Ye have doubtless heard 
This from your parents, be they who they may ; 
For much have I endured, and I have lost 
A palace, a most noble dwelling-place, 
Full of things rare and precious. Even now «$ 



Book IV. 67 

Would I possessed within my palace here 

But the third part of these ; and would that they 

Were yet alive who perished on the plain 

Of Troy afar from Argos and its steeds ! 

Yet while I grieve and while I mourn them all, 130 

Here, sitting in my palace, I by turns 

Indulge my heart in weeping, and by turns 

I pause, for with continual sorrow comes 

A weariness of spirit. Yet, in truth, 

For none of all those warriors, though their fate 13s 

Afflicts me sorely, do I so much grieve 

As for one hero. When I think of him, 

The feast and couch are joyless, since, of all 

The Achaian chiefs, none brought so much to pass 

As did Ulysses, both in what he wrought 140 

And what he suffered. Great calamities 

Fell to his lot in life, and to my own 

Grief for his sake that cannot be consoled. 

Long has he been divided from his friends, 

And whether he be living now or dead 14s 

We know not. Old Laertes, the sage queen 

Penelope, and young Telemachus, 

Whom, when he went to war he left new-born 

At home, are sorrowing somewhere for his sake." 

He spake, and woke anew the young man's grief i» 
For his lost father. From his eyelids fell 
Tears at the hearing of his father's name, 
And with both hands he held before his eyes 
The purple mantle. Menelaus saw 



68 The Odyssey. 

His tears, and pondered, doubting which were 
best, — iss 

To let the stranger of his own accord 
Speak of his father, or to question him 
At first, and then to tell him all he knew. 

As thus he pondered, Helen, like in form 
To Dian of the golden distaff, left 160 

Her high-roofed chamber, where the air was sweet 
With perfumes, and approached. Adrasta placed 
A seat for her of costly workmanship ; 
Alcippe brought a mat of soft light wool, 
And Phylo with a silver basket came, 165 

Given by Alcandra, wife of Polybus, 
Who dwelt at Thebes, in Egypt, and whose house 
Was rich in things of price. Two silver baths 
He gave to Menelaus, tripods two, 
And talents ten of gold. His wife bestowed 170 
Beautiful gifts on Helen, — one of gold, 
A distaff; one a silver basket edged 
With gold and round in form. This Phylo brought 
Heaped with spun yarn and placed before the queen ; 
Upon it lay the distaff, wrapped in wool 17s 

Of color like the violet. Helen there 
Sat down, a footstool at her feet, and straight 
Questioned with earnest words her husband thus : — 

" Say, Menelaus, foster-child of Jove, 
Is it yet known what lineage these men claim, — 180 
These visitants ? And what I now shall say, 
Will it be false or true ? Yet must I speak. 



Book IV. 69 

Woman or man I think I never saw 

So like another as this youth, on whom 

I look with deep astonishment, is like iss 

Telemachus, the son whom our great chief 

Ulysses left at home a tender babe 

When ye Achaians for my guilty sake 

Went forth to wage the bloody war with Troy." 

And fair-haired Menelaus answered her : — 190 
" Yea, wife, so deem I as it seems to thee. 
Such are his feet, his hands, the cast of the eye, 
His head, the hair upon his brow. Just now, 
In speaking of Ulysses, as I told 
How he had toiled and suffered for my sake, i«s 
The stranger held the purple cloak before 
His eyes, and from the lids dropped bitter tears." 

Peisistratus, the son of Nestor, spake 
In answer : " Menelaus, foster-child 
Of Jove and son of Atreus ! sovereign king ! 300 

He is, as thou hast said, that hero's son ; 
But he is modest, and he deems that ill 
It would become him, on arriving here, 
If he should venture in discourse while thou 
Art present, in whose voice we take delight 205 

As if it were the utterance of a god. 
The knight Gerenian Nestor sent me forth 
To guide him hither, — for he earnestly 
Desired to see thee, that thou mightest give 
Counsel in what he yet should say or da *m 

For bitterly a son, who finds at home 



JO The Odyssey 

No others to befriend him, must lament 

The absence of a father. So it is 

With young Telemachus ; for far away 

His father is, and in the land are none sis 

Who have the power to shelter him from wrong." 

The fair-haired Menelaus answered thus : — 
" O wonder ! Then the son of one most dear, 
Who for my sake so oft has braved and borne 
The conflicts of the battle-field, hath come 220 

Beneath my roof. I thought that I should greet 
His father with a warmer welcome here 
Than any other of the Argive race, 
When Jove the Olympian Thunderer should grant 
A safe return to us across the deep «s 

In our good ships. I would have founded here 
For him a city in Argos, and have built 
Dwellings, and would have brought from Ithaca 
Him and his son, and all his wealth and all 
His people. To this end I would have caused 23c 
Some neighboring district where my sway is owned 
To be dispeopled. Dwelling here we oft 
Should then have met each other, and no cause 
Would e'er have parted us, two faithful friends 
Delighting in each other, till at last 23s 

Came Death's black cloud to wrap us in its shade. 
A god, no doubt, hath seen in this a good 
Too great for us, and thus to him alone, 
Unhappy man ! denied a safe return." 

He spake ; his words awoke in every heart »« 



Book IV. 71 

Grief for the absent hero's sake. Then wept 

The Argive Helen, child of Jove ; then wept 

Telemachus ; nor tearless were the eyes 

Of Nestor's son, for to his mind arose 

The memory of the good Antilochus, 24s 

Slain by the bright Aurora's eminent son ; 

Of him he thought, and spake these winged words :— 

" O son of Atreus ! aged Nestor saith, 
When in his palace we discourse of thee 
And ask each other's thought, that thou art wise 250 
Beyond all other men. Now, if thou mayst, 
Indulge me, for not willingly I weep 
Thus at the evening feast, and soon will Morn, 
Child of the Dawn, appear. I do not blame 
This sorrow for whoever meets his fate 25s 

And dies ; the only honors we can pay 
To those unhappy mortals is to shred 
Our locks away, and wet our cheeks with tears. 
I lost a brother, not the least in worth 
Among the Argives, whom thou must have seen. 26c 
I knew him not : I never saw his face ; 
Yet is it said Antilochus excelled 
The others ; swift of foot, and brave in war." 

The fair-haired Menelaus answered him : — 
" Since thou my friend hast spoken thus, as one 265 
Discreet in word and deed, of riper years 
Than thou, might speak and act, — for thou art born 
Of such a father, and thy words are wise, — 
A.nd easy is it to discern the son 



72 The Odyssey. 

Of one on whom Saturnius has bestowed *> 

Both at the birth-hour and in wedded life 

His blessing ; as he gives to Nestor now 

A calm old age that lapses pleasantly, 

Within his palace-halls, from day to day, 

And sons wise-minded, mighty with the spear, — 275 

Then let us lay aside this sudden grief 

That has o'ertaken us, and only think 

Of banqueting. Let water now be poured 

Upon our hands ; there will be time enough 

To-morrow for discourse ; Telemachus 280 

And I will then engage in mutual talk." 

He spake, Asphalion, who with diligent heed 
Served the great Menelaus, on their hands 
Poured water, and they shared the meats that lay 
Upon the board. But Helen, Jove-born dame, &* 
Had other thoughts, and with the wine they drank 
Mingled a drug, an antidote to grief 
And anger, bringing quick forgetfulness 
Of all life's evils. Whoso drinks, when once 
It is infused and in the cup, that day ^ 

Shall never wet his cheeks with tears, although 
His father and his mother lie in death, 
Nor though his brother or beloved son 
Fall butchered by the sword before his eyes. 
Such sovereign drugs she had, that child of Jove, =a 
Given her by Polydamna, wife of Thon, 
A dame of Egypt, where the bounteous soil 
Brings forth abundantly its potent herbs, 



Book IV. 73 

Of healing some and some of bane, and where 
Dwell the physicians who excel in skill 300 

All other men, for they are of the race 
Of Paeon. Now when Helen in the cups 
Had placed the drug, and bidden them to pour 
The wine upon it, thus she spake again : — 

" Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove, jos 

And ye the sons of heroes ! — Jupiter 
The sovereign, gives, at pleasure, good and ill 
To one or to another, for his power 
Is infinite, — now sitting in these halls, 
Feast and enjoy free converse. I will speak 310 
What suits the occasion. I could not relate, 
I could not even name, the many toils 
Borne by Ulysses, stout of heart. I speak 
Only of what that valiant warrior did 
And suffered once in Troy, where ye of Greece 315 
Endured such hardships. He had given himself 
Unseemly stripes, and o'er his shoulders flung 
Vile garments like a slave's, and entered thus 
The enemy's town, and walked its spacious streets. 
Another man he seemed in that disguise, — 3^ 

A beggar, though when at the Achaian fleet 
So different was the semblance that he wore. 
He entered Ilium thus transformed, and none 
Knew who it was that passed, but I perceived, 
And questioned him ; he turned my quest aside 3»* 
With crafty answers. After I had seen 
The bath administered, anointed him 
vol. 1. 4 



74 The Odyssey. 

And clothed him, and had sworn a solemii oath 
Not to reveal his visit to the men 
Of Ilium till he reached again the tents 
And galleys, then he opened to me all 
The plans of the Achaians. Leaving me, 
On his return he slew with his long spear 
Full many a Trojan, and in safety reached 
The Argive camp with tidings for the host. 
Then wept aloud the Trojan dames, but I 
Was glad at heart, for I already longed 
For my old home, and deeply I deplored 
The evil fate that Venus brought on me, 
Who led me thither from my own dear land, 
And from my daughter and my marriage-bower, 
And from my lawful spouse., in whom I missed 
No noble gift of person or of mind." 

Then fair-haired Menelaus said to her : — 
u All thou hast spoken, woman, is most true. 
Of many a valiant warrior I have known 
The counsels and the purposes, and far 
Have roamed in many lands, but never yet 
My eyes have looked on such another man 
As was Ulysses, of a heart so bold 
And such endurance. Witness what he did 
And bore, the heroic man, what time we sat, 
The bravest of the Argives, pent within 
The wooden horse, about to bring to Troy 
Slaughter and death. Thou earnest to the place, 
Moved, as it seemed, by some divinity 



Book IV. 75 

Who thought to give the glory of the day 

To Troy. Deiphobus, the godlike chief, 

Was with thee. Thrice about the hollow frame 

That held the ambush thou didst walk and touch 360 

Its sides, and call the Achaian chiefs by name, 

And imitate the voices of the wives 

Of all the Argives. Diomed and I 

Sat with the great Ulysses in the midst, 

And with him heard thy call, and rose at once 365 

To sally forth or answer from within ; 

But he forbade, impatient as we were, 

And so restrained us. All the Achaian chiefs 

Kept silence save Anticlus, who alone 

Began to speak, when, with his powerful hands, 370 

Ulysses pressed together instantly 

The opening lips, and saved us all, and thus 

Held them till Pallas lured thee from the spot." 

Then spake discreet Telemachus again : — 
" Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove, 37s 

Ruler of tribes ! the harder was his lot, 
Since even thus he could not shun the stroke 
Of death, not though a heart of steel were his. 
But now dismiss us to our beds, that there, 
Couched softly, we may welcome balmy sleep." 380 

He spake, and Argive Helen called her maids 
To make up couches in the portico, 
And throw fair purple blankets over them, 
And tapestry above, and cover all 
With shaggy cloaks. Forth from the palace halls 38s 



y6 The Odyssey. 

They went with torches, and made ready soon 

The couches ; thither heralds led the guests. 

There in the vestibule Telemachus, 

The hero, and with him the eminent son 

Of Nestor, took their rest. Meanwhile the son 390 

Of Atreus lay within an inner room 

Of that magnificent pile, and near to him 

The glorious lady, long-robed Helen, slept. 

But when at length the daughter of the Dawn, 

The rosy-fingered Morning, brought her light, 39s 

Then Menelaus, great in battle, rose, 

Put on his garments, took his trenchant sword, 

And, having hung it on his shoulder, laced 

The shapely sandals to his shining feet, 

And issued from his chamber like a god am 

In aspect. Near Telemachus he took 

His seat, and calling him by name he spake : — 

" What urgent cause, my brave Telemachus, 
Brings thee to sacred Lacedaemon o'er 
The breast of the great ocean ? Frankly say, 405 
Is it a private or a public need ? " 

And thus discreet Telemachus replied : — 
u Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove, 
Ruler of nations ! I am come to ask 
News of my father, if thou knowest aught. 410 

My heritage is wasting ; my rich fields 
Are made a desolation. Enemies 
Swarm in my palace, and from day to day 
Slaughter my flocks and slow-paced horned herds ; 



Book IV. 77 

My mother's suitors they, and measureless vs 

Their insolence. And therefore am I come 

To clasp thy knees, and pray thee to relate 

The manner of my father's sorrowful death 

As thou hast seen it with thine eyes, or heard 

Its story from some wandering man, — for sure *» 

His mother brought him forth to wretchedness 

Beyond the common lot. I ask thee not 

To soften aught in the sad history 

Through tenderness to me, or kind regard^ 

But tell me plainly ail that thou dost know ; ^s 

And I beseech thee, if at any time 

My father, good Ulysses, brought to pass 

Aught that he undertook for thee in word 

Or act while ye were in the realm of Troy, 

Where the Greeks suffered sorely, bear it now 430 

In mind, and let me have the naked truth." 

Then Menelaus of the amber locks 
Drew a deep sigh, and thus in answer said : — 
" Heavens ! they would climb into a brave man's bed, 
These craven weaklings. But as when a hart «a 
Has hid her new-born suckling fawns within 
The lai/ of some fierce lion, and gone forth 
Herself to range the mountain-sides and feed 
Among the grassy lawns, the lion comes 
Back to the place and brings them sudden death, «/ 
So will Ulysses bring a bloody fate 
Upon the suitor crew. O father Jove, 
And Pallas, and Apollo ! I could wish 



?8 The Odyssey. 

That now, with prowess such as once was his 
When he, of yore, in Lesbos nobly built, 445 

Rising to strive with Philomela's son, 
In wrestling threw him heavily, and all 
The Greeks rejoiced, Ulysses might engage 
The suitors. Short were then their term of life, 
And bitter would the nuptial banquet be. 4s° 

Now for the questions thou hast put, and craved 
From me a true reply, I will not seek 
To pass them by with talk of other things, 
Nor yet deceive thee, but of all that once 
Was told me by the Ancient of the Deep, 4ss 

Whose words are truth, I shall keep nothing back. 
" In Egypt still, though longing to come home, 
The gods detained me ; for I had not paid 
The sacrifice of chosen hecatombs, 
And ever do the gods require of us 460 

Remembrance of their laws. There is an isle 
Within the billowy sea before you reach 
The coast of Egypt, — Pharos is its name, — 
At such a distance as a ship could pass 
In one whole day with a shrill breeze astern. 465 
A sheltered haven lies within that isle, 
Whence the good ships go forth with fresh supplies 
Of water. There the gods constrained my stay 
For twenty days, and never in that time 
Blew favoring winds across the waters, such 470 

As bear the galley over the great deep. 
Now would our stores of food have been consumed, 



Book IV. 79 

Now would the courage of my men have died, 
Had not a goddess pitied me, and come 
To my relief, by name Idothea, born 47s 

To the great Proteus, Ancient of the Deep. 
For she was moved by my distress, and came 
To me while I was wandering alone, 
Apart from all the rest. They through the isle 
Roamed everywhere from place to place, and, 
pinched 480 

With hunger, threw the hook for fish. She came, 
And, standing near, accosted me and said : — 

" ' Stranger, thou art an idiot, or at least 
Of careless mood, or else art willingly 
Neglectful, and art pleased with suffering, 485 

That thou dost linger in this isle so long 
And find no means to leave it, while the hearts 
Of thy companions faint with the delay/ 

" She spake, and I replied : ' Whoe'er thou art, 

goddess, let me say, not willingly 490 

1 linger here. I surely must have sinned 
Against the immortal dwellers of high heaven ; 
But tell me — for the gods know all things — who 
Of all the immortals holds me windbound here, 
Hindering my voyage ; tell me also how 495 
To reach my home across the fishy deep.' 

u I ended, and the glorious goddess said 
In answer : ' Stranger, I will truly speak ; 
The deathless Ancient of the Deep, whose words 
Are ever true, Egyptian Proteus, oft s*> 



80 The Odyssey. 

Here makes his haunt. To him are fully known — 
For he is Neptune's subject — all the depths 
Of the great ocean. It is said I owe 
To him my birth. If him thou canst insnare 
And seize, he will disclose to thee thy way 505 

And all its distances, and tell thee how 
To reach thy home across the fishy deep ; 
And further will reveal, if so he choose, 

foster-child of Jove, whate'er of good 

Or ill has in thy palace come to pass, 5*° 

While thou wert wandering long and wearily.' 

" So said the goddess, and I spake again : — 
4 Explain by what device to snare and hold 
The aged deity, lest he foreknow 
Or else suspect our purpose and escape. 515 

'T were hard for mortals to constrain a god.' 

" I ended, and the glorious goddess thus 
Made answer : ' When the climbing sun has reached 
The middle heaven, the Ancient of the Deep, 
Who ne'er deceives, emerges from the waves, 520 
And, covered with the dark scum of the sea, 
Walks forth, and in a cavern vault lies down. 
Thither fair Halosydna's progeny, 
The sea-calves from the hoary ocean, throng, 
Rank with the bitter odor of the brine, 525 

And slumber near him. With the break of day 

1 will conduct thee thither and appoint 

Thy place, but thou shalt choose to go with thee 
Three of the bravest men in thy good ships. 



Book IV. 8 1 

And let me now relate the stratagems 53* 

Of the old prophet. He at first will count 
The sea-calves, going o'er them all by fives ; 
And when he has beheld and numbered all, 
Amidst them all will he lie down, as lies 
A shepherd midst his flock. And then, as soon 53s 
As ye behold him stretched at length, exert 
Your utmost strength to hold him there, although 
He strive and struggle to escape your hands ; 
For he will try all stratagems, and take 
The form of every reptile on the earth, w» 

And turn to water and to raging flame, — 
Yet hold him firmly still, and all the more 
Make fast the bands. When he again shall take 
The form in which thou sawest him asleep, 
Desist from force, and loose the bands that held 543 
The ancient prophet. Ask of him what god 
Afflicts thee thus, and by what means to cross 
The fishy deep and find thy home again.' 

" Thus having said, the goddess straightway sprang 
Into the billowy ocean, while I sought 55° 

The galleys, where they rested on the sand, 
With an uneasy spirit. When I reached 
The ship and shore we made our evening meal. 
The hallowed night came down ; we lay and slept 
Upon the sea-beach. When the Morning came, sss 
The rosy-fingered daughter of the Dawn, 
Forth on the border of the mighty main 
I went, and prayed the immortals fervently. 



82 The Odyssey. 

I led ;hree comrades, whom I trusted most 

In a\i adventures. Entering the depths 560 

Of the great sea, the goddess brought us thence 

Four skins of sea-calves newly flayed, that thus 

We might deceive her father. Then she scooped 

Beds for us in the sea-sand, and sat down 

To wait his coming. We were near to her, 565 

And there she laid us duly down, and threw 

A skin o'er each. Now did our ambush seem 

Beyond endurance, for the noisome smell 

Of those sea-nourished creatures sickened us ; 

And who could bear to sleep beside a whale ? 570 

But she bethought her of an antidote, 

A sovereign one, and so relieved us all. 

To each she brought ambrosia, placing it 

Beneath his nostrils, and the sweets it breathed 

O'ercame the animal odor. All the morn 575 

We waited patiently. The sea-calves came 

From ocean in a throng, and laid themselves 

In rows along the margin of the sea. 

At noon emerged the aged seer, and found 

His well-fed sea-calves. Going o'er them all sso 

He counted them, ourselves among the rest, 

With no misgiving of the fraud, and then 

He laid him down to rest. We rushed with shouts 

Upon him suddenly, and in our arms 

Caught him ; nor did the aged seer forget sss 

His stratagems ; and first he took the shape 

Of a maned lion, of a serpent next, 



Book IV. 83 

Then of a panther, then of a huge boar, 

Then turned to flowing water, then became 

A tall tree full of leaves. With resolute hearts 590 

We held him fast, until the aged seer 

Was wearied out, in spite of all his wiles. 

And questioned me in speech at last and said : — 

" * O son of Atreus ! who of all the gods 
Hath taught thee how to take me in this snare, 595 
Unwilling as I am ? What wouldst thou have ? ' 

" He spake ; I answered : ' Aged prophet, well 
Thou knowest. Why deceitfully inquire ? 
It is that I am held a prisoner long 
Within this isle, and vainly seek the means &» 

Of my escape, and grief consumes my heart. 
Now — since the gods know all things — tell me this, 
What deity it is, that, hindering thus 
My voyage, keeps me here, and tell me how 
To cross the fishy deep and reach my home/ ^s 

" Such were my words, and he in answer said : — 
1 i3ut thou to Jove and to the other gods 
Shouldst first have paid acceptable sacrifice, 
And shouldst have then embarked to reach with 

speed 
Thy native land across the dark-blue deep. 6w 

Now it is not thy fate to see again 
Thy friends, thy stately palace, and the land 
That saw thy birth, until thou stand once more 
Beside the river that through Egypt flows 
From Jove, and offer sacred hecatombs *»5 



84 The Odyssey. 

To the ever-living gods inhabiting 

The boundless heaven, and they will speed thee 

forth 
Upon the voyage thou dost long to make.' 

" He spake. My heart was broken as I heard 
His bidding to recross the shadowy sea 620. 

To Egypt, for the way was difficult 
And long ; and yet I answered him and said : — 

" ' Duly will I perform, O aged seer, 
What thou commandest. But I pray thee tell, 
And truly, whether all the sons of Greece 6 2S 

Whom Nestor and myself, in setting sail, 
Left on the Trojan coast, have since returned 
Safe with their galleys, or have any died 
Untimely in their ships or in the arms 
Of their companions since the war wasclosed ? ' 630 

" I spake ; again he answered me and said : — 
* Why dost thou ask, Atrides, since to know 
Thou needest not, nor is it well to explore 
The secrets of my mind ? Thou canst not, sure, 
Refrain from tears when thou shalt know the 
whole. 535 

Many are dead, and many left in Troy. 
Two leaders only of the well-armed Greeks 
Were slain returning ; in that combat thou 
Didst bear a part ; one, living yet, is kept, 
Far in the mighty main, from his return. <** 

" ' Amid his well-oared galleys Ajax died. 
For Neptune first had driven him on the rocks 



Book IV. 85 

Of Gyrae, yet had saved him from the sea ; 

And he, though Pallas hated him, had yet 

Been rescued, but for uttering boastful words, 645 

Which drew his fate upon him. He had said 

That he, in spite of all the gods, would come 

Safe from those mountain waves. When Neptune 

heard 
The boaster's challenge, instantly he laid 
His strong hand on the trident, smote the rock 650 
And cleft it to the base. Part stood erect, 
Part fell into the deep. There Ajax sat, 
And felt the shock, and with the falling mass 
Was carried headlong to the billowy depths 
Below, and drank the brine and perished there. 6 SS 
Thy brother in his roomy ships escaped 
The danger, for imperial Juno's aid 
Preserved him. But when near Meleia's heights 
About to land, a tempest seized and swept 
The hero thence across the fishy deep, eoo 

Lamenting his hard lot, to that far cape 
Where once abode Thyestes, and where now 
His son ^Egisthus dwelt. But when the gods 
Sent other winds, and safe at last appeared 
The voyage, they returned, and reached their 

home. 665 

With joy he stepped upon his native soil, 
And kissed the earth that bore him, while his tears 
At that most welcome sight flowed fast and warm. 
Him from a lofty perch a spy beheld, 



86 The Odyssey. 

Whom treacherous ^Egisthus planted there, 6 70 

Bribed by two golden talents. He had watched 

The whole year through, lest, coming unobserved, 

The king might make his prowess felt. The spy 

Flew to the royal palace with the news, 

And instantly ^Egisthus planned a snare. 6 7S 

He chose among the people twenty men, 

The bravest, whom he stationed out of sight, 

And gave command that others should prepare 

A banquet. Then with chariots and with steeds, 

And with a deadly purpose in his heart, 680 

He went, and, meeting Agamemnon, bade 

The shepherd of the people to the feast, 

And slew him at the board as men might slay 

A bullock at the crib. Of all who went 

With Agamemnon thither, none survived, 6s s 

And of the followers of ./Egisthus none, 

But all were slaughtered in the banquet-hall/ 

" He spake ; my heart was breaking, and I wept, 
While sitting on the sand, nor in my heart 
Cared I to live, or longer to behold &» 

The sweet light of the sun. But when there came 
Respite from tears and writhing on the ground, 
The Ancient of the Deep, who ne'er deceives, 
Spake yet again : ' Atrides, lose no time 
In tears ; they profit nothing. Rather seek 6 95 

The means by which thou mayst the soonest reach 
Thy native land. There thou perchance mayst find 
^Egisthus yet alive, or haply first 



Book IV. 87 

Orestes may have slain him, and thyself 

Arrive to see the funeral rites performed.' 700 

w He spake, and though afflicted still, my heart 
Was somewhat comforted ; my spirit rose, 
And thus I answered him with winged words : — 

" ' These men I know ; name now the third, who 
still 
Is kept from his return afar within 705 

The mighty main, — alive, perchance, or dead ; 
For, though I dread to hear, I long to know.' 

" I spake, and Proteus answered me again : — 
' It is Laertes' son, whose dwelling stands 
In Ithaca. I saw him in an isle, 710 

And in the cavern-palace of the nymph 
Calypso, weeping bitterly, for she 
Constrains his stay. He cannot leave the isle 
For his own country ; ship arrayed with oars 
And seamen has he none to bear him o'er 71s 

The breast of the great ocean. But for thee, 
T is not decreed that thou shalt meet thy fate 
And die, most noble Menelaus, where 
The steeds of Argos in her pastures graze. 
The gods will send thee to the Elysian plain, 720 
And to the end of earth, the dwelling-place 
Of fair-haired Rhadamanthus. There do men 
Lead easiest lives. No snow, no bitter cold, 
No beating rains, are there ; the ocean-deeps 
With murmuring breezes from the West refresh 72s 
The dwellers. Thither shalt thou go ; for thou 



8S The Odyssey. 

Art Helen's spouse, and son-in-law of Jove.' 

<{ He spake, and plunged into the billowy deep. 
I to the fleet returned in company 
With my brave men, revolving, as I went, 73* 

A thousand projects in my thought. I reached 
My galley by the sea, and we prepared 
Our evening meal. The hallowed night came down, 
And there upon the ocean-beach we slept. 
But when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared, 73s 

The daughter of the Dawn, we drew our ships 
To the great deep, and raised the masts and spread 
The sails ; the crews, all entering, took their seats 
Upon the benches, ranged in order due, 
And beat the foaming water with their oars. 7* 

Again to Egypt's coast I brought the fleet, 
And to the river that descends from Jove, 
And there I offered chosen hecatombs ; 
And having thus appeased the gods, I reared 
A tomb to Agamemnon, that his fame 74s 

Might never die. When this was done I sailed 
For home ; the gods bestowed a favoring wind. 
But now remain thou till the eleventh day, 
Or till the twelfth, beneath my roof, and then 
Will I dismiss thee with munificent gifts, — 7s» 

Three steeds, a polished chariot, and a cup 
Of price, with which to pour, from day to day, 
Wine to the gods in memory of me." 

Then spake discreet Telemachus again : — 
" Atrides, seek not to detain me long, 75s 



Book IV. 89 

Though I could sit contentedly a year 
Beside thee, never longing for my home, 
Nor for my parents, such delight I find 
In listening to thy words ; but even now, 
In hallowed Pylos, my companions grow 760 

Weary, while thou delayest my return. 
The gifts, — whate'er thou choosest to bestow, — 
Let them be such as I can treasure up. 
The steeds to Ithaca I may not take, 
I leave them to adorn thy retinue ; 765 

For thou art ruler o'er a realm of plains, 
Where grows much lotos, and sweet grasses spring, 
And wheat and rye, and the luxuriant stalks 
Of the white barley. But in Ithaca 
Are no broad grounds for coursing, meadows 
none. 770 

Goats graze amid its fields, a fairer land 
Than those where horses feed. No isle that lies 
Within the deep has either roads for steeds 
Or meadows, least of all has Ithaca." 

He spake ; the valiant Menelaus smiled, 77s 

And kindly touched him with his hand and said : — 

" Dear son, thou comest of a generous stock ; 
Thy words declare it. I will change my gifts, 
As well I may. Of all that in my house 
Are treasured up, the choicest I will give, 7* 

And the most precious. I will give a cup 
Wrought all of silver save its brim of gold. 
It is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus 



90 The Odyssey. 

The hero, King of Sidon, gave it me, 

When I was coming home, and underneath 785 

His roof was sheltered. Now it shall be thine." 

So talked they with each other. Meantime came 
Those who prepared the banquet to the halls 
Of the great monarch. Bringing sheep they came 
And strengthening wine. Their wives, who on their 
brows 790 

Wore showy fillets, brought the bread, and thus 
Within the house of Menelaus all 
Was bustle, setting forth the evening meal. 

But in the well-paved court which lay before 
The palace of Ulysses, where of late 79s 

Their insolence was shown, the suitor train 
Amused themselves with casting quoits and spears, 
While by themselves Antinous, and the youth 
Of godlike mien, Eurymachus, who both 
Were eminent above the others, sat. &00 

To them Noemon, son of Phronius, went, 
Drew near, bespake Antinous and inquired : — 

" Is it among us known, or is it not, 
Antinous, when Telemachus returns 
From sandy Pylos ? Thither he is gone so S 

And in my galley, which I need to cross 
To spacious Elis. There I have twelve mares 
And hardy mule-colts with them yet untamed, 
A.nd some I must subdue to take the yoke." 

He spake, and they were both amazed ; for they s» 
Had never thought of him as visiting 



Book IV. 91 

Neleian Pylos, deeming that the youth 

Was somewhere in his fields, among the flocks, 

Or haply with the keeper of the swine. 

Then did Antinous, Eupeithes' son, si S 

Make answer : " Tell me truly when he sailed, 
And what young men of Ithaca he chose 
To go with him. Were they his slaves, or hired 
To be his followers ? Tell, for I would know 
The whole. Took he thy ship against thy will ? 820 
Or didst thou yield it at his first request ? " 

Noemon, son of Phornius, thus replied : — 
11 Most willingly I gave it, for what else 
Would any one have done when such a man 
Desired it in his need ? It would have been 825 
Hard to deny it. For the band of youths 
Who followed him, they are the bravest here 
Of all our people ; and I saw embark, 
As their commander, Mentor, or some god 
Like Mentor altogether. One thing moves »r 

My wonder. Only yesterday, at dawn, 
I met with Mentor here, whom I before 
Had seen embarking for the Pylian coast." 

Noemon spake, and to his father's house 
Departed. Both were troubled at his words, 8 35 
And all the suitors took at once their seats, 
And ceased their pastimes. Then Antinous spake, 
Son of Eupeithes, greatly vexed ; his heart 
Was darkened with blind rage ; his eyes shot fire. 

" Strange doings these ! a great and proud exploit 



92 The Odyssey. 

Performed, — this voyage of Telemachus, 841 

Which we had called impossible ! The boy, 

In spite of us, has had his will and gone, 

And carried off a ship, and for his crew 

Chosen the bravest of the people here. 84s 

He yet will prove a pest. May Jupiter 

Crush him ere he can work us further harm ! 

Now give me a swift bark and twenty men 

That I may lie in ambush and keep watch 

For his return within the straits between 850 

This isle and rugged Samos ; then, I deem, 

He will have sought his father to his cost." 

He spake ; they praised his words and bade him 
act, 
And rose and left their places, entering 
The palace of Ulysses. Brief the time s S s 

That passed before Penelope was warned 
Of what the suitors treacherously planned. 
The herald Medon told her all. He heard 
In the outer court their counsels while within 
They plotted, and he hastened through the house 860 
To bring the tidings to Penelope. 
Penelope perceived him as he stepped 
Across the threshold, and bespake him thus : — 

" Why, herald, have the suitor princes sent 
Thee hither ? comest thou to bid the maids *s 

Of great Ulysses leave their tasks and make 
A banquet ready ? Would their wooing here 
And elsewhere were but ended, and this feast 



Book IV. 93 

Were their last feast on earth ! Ye who in throngs 
Come hither and so wastefully consume s 7 o 

The substance of the brave Telemachus, 
Have ye not from your parents, while ye yet 
Were children, heard how once Ulysses lived 
Among them, never wronging any man 
In all the realm by aught he did or said, — 875 

As mighty princes often do, through hate 
Of some and love of others ? Never man 
Endured injustice at his hands, but you — 
Your vile designs and acts are known ; ye bear 
No grateful memory of a good man's deeds." *&> 

And then, in turn, experienced Medon spake : — 
" O queen, I would this evil were the worst ! 
The suitors meditate a greater still, 
And a more heinous far. May Jupiter 
Never permit the crime ! Their purpose is 885 

To meet Telemachus, on his return, 
And slay him with the sword ; for thou must know 
That on a voyage to the Pylian coast 
And noble Lacedaemon he has sailed, 
To gather tidings of his father's fate." %* 

He spake, and her knees failed her and her heart 
Sank as she heard. Long time she could not speak ; 
Her eyes were filled with tears, and her clear voice 
Was choked ; yet, finding words at length, she 
said : — 

"O herald! wherefore should my son have 
gone ? 89s 



94 The Odyssey. 

There was no need that he should trust himself 
To the swift ships, those horses of the sea, 
With which men traverse its unmeasured waste. 
Was it that he might leave no name on earth ? * 

And then again experienced Medon spake : — y» 
" I know not whether prompted by some god 
Or moved by his own heart thy son has sailed 
For Pylos, hoping there to hear some news 
Of his returning father, or his fate." 

Thus having said, the herald, traversing 905 

The palace of Ulysses, went his way, 
While a keen anguish overpowered the queen, 
Nor could she longer bear to keep her place 
Upon her seat, — and many seats were there, — 
But on the threshold of her gorgeous rooms &• 

Lay piteously lamenting. Round her came 
Her maidens wailing, — all, both old and young, 
Who formed her household. These Penelope, 
Sobbing in her great sorrow, thus bespake : — 

" Hear me, my friends, the heavens have cast on 
me 915 

Grisfs heavier than on any others born 
And reared with me, — me, who had lost by death 
Already a most gracious husband, one 
Who bore a lion heart and who was graced 
With every virtue, greatly eminent 9* 

Among the Greeks, and widely famed abroad 
Through Hellas and all Argos. Now my son, 
He whom I loved, is driven before the storms 



Book IV. 95 

From home, inglorious, and I was not told 

Of his departure. Ye too, worthless crew ! 92s 

Ye took no thought, not one of you, to call 

Me from my sleep, although ye must have known 

Full well when he embarked in his black ship. 

And if it had been told me that he planned 

This voyage, then, impatient as he was 930 

To sail, he would have certainly remained, 

Or else have left me in these halls a corpse. 

And now let one of my attendants call 

The aged Dolius, whom, when first I came 

To this abode, my father gave to me 93s 

To be my servant, and who has in charge 

My orchards. Let him haste and take his place 

Beside Laertes, and to him declare 

All that has happened, that he may devise 

Some fitting remedy, or go among 940 

The people, to deplore the dark designs 

Of those who now are plotting to destroy 

The heir of great Ulysses and his own." 

Then Eurycleia, the beloved nurse, 
Answered : " Dear lady, slay me with the sword, 943 
Or leave me here alive ; I will conceal 
Nothing that has been done or said. I gave 
All that he asked, both bread and delicate wine, 
And took a solemn oath, which he required, 
To tell thee naught of this till twelve days passed, 950 
Or till thou shouldst thyself inquire and hear 
Of his departure, that those lovely cheeks 



g6 The Odyssey. 

Might not be stained with tears. Now bathe and put 

Fresh garments on, and to the upper rooms 

Ascending, with thy handmaids offer prayer 955 

To Pallas, daughter of the god who bears 

The aegis. She will then protect thy son, 

Even from death. Grieve not the aged man, 

Already much afflicted. Sure I am 

The lineage of Arcesius has not lost <& 

The favor of the gods, but some one yet 

Surviving will possess its lofty halls 

And its rich acres, stretching far away." 

She spake; the queen repressed her grief, and held 
Her eyes from tears. She took the bath and put 96s 
Fresh garments on, and, to the upper rooms 
Ascending with her maidens, heaped with cakes 
A canister, and prayed to Pallas thus : — 

" Daughter invincible of Jupiter 
The ^Egis-bearer, hear me. If within 970 

Thy courts the wise Ulysses ever burned 
Fat thighs of beeves or sheep, remember it, 
And rescue my dear son, and bring to naught 
The wicked plots of the proud suitor-crew.' : 

She spake, and wept aloud. The goddess heard 97s 
Her prayer. Meantime the suitors filled with noise 
The shadowy palace-halls, and there were some 
Among that throng of arrogant youths who said : — 

" Truly the queen, whom we have wooed so long, 
Prepares for marriage ; little does she know 9* 

The bloody death we destine for her son." 



Book IV. 97 

So spake they, unaware of what was done 
Elsewhere. Antinoiis then stood forth and said : — 

" Good friends, I warn you all that ye refrain 
From boasts like these, lest some one should re- 
port 98; 
Your words within. Now let us silently 
Rise up, and all conspire to put in act 
The counsel all so heartily approve." 

He spake, and chose a crew of twenty men, 
The bravest. To the seaside and the ship 99 

They went, and down to the deep water drew 
The ship, and put the mast and sails on board, 
And fitted duly to their leathern rings 
The oars, and spread the white sail overhead. 
Their nimble-handed servants brought them arms, * 
And there they moored the galley, went on board, 
And supped and waited for the evening star. 

Now in the upper chamber the chaste queen, 
Penelope, lay fasting ; food or wine 
She had not tasted, and her thoughts were still 1000 
Fixed on her blameless son. Would he escape 
The threatened death, or perish by the hands 
Of the insolent suitors ? As a lion's thoughts, 
When, midst a crowd of men, he sees with dread 
The hostile circle slowly closing round, 1005 

Such were her thoughts, when balmy sleep at length 
Came creeping over her as on her couch 
She lay reclined, her limbs relaxed in rest. 

Now Pallas framed a new device ; she called 

VOL. I. 5 G 



98 The Odyssey. 

A phantom up, in aspect like the dame 1010 

Iphthima, whom Eumelus had espoused 

In Pherae, daughter of the high-souled chief 

Icarius. Her she sent into the halls 

Of great Ulysses, that she might beguile 

The sorrowful Penelope from tears 1015 

And lamentations. By the thong that held 

The bolt she slid into the royal bower 

And standing by her head bespake the queen . — 

" Penelope, afflicted as thou art, 
Art thou asleep ? The ever-blessed gods 1020 

Permit thee not to grieve and weep ; thy son, 
Who has not sinned against them, shall return." 

And then discreet Penelope replied, 
Still sweetly slumbering at the Gate of Dreams : — . 

" Why, sister, art thou here, who ne'er before 1025 
Hast come to me ? The home is far away 
In which thou dwellest. Thou exhortest me 
To cease from grieving, and to lay aside 
The painful thoughts that crowd into my mind, 
And torture me who have already lost »* 

A noble-minded, lion-hearted spouse, 
One eminent among Achaia's sons 
For every virtue, and whose fame was spread 
Through Hellas and through Argos. Now my son, 
My best beloved, goes to sea, — a boy, 1035 

Unused to hardships, and unskilled to deal 
With strangers. More I sorrow for his sake 
Than for his father's. I am filled with fear. 



Book IV. 99 

And tremble lest he suffer wrong from those 
Among whom he has gone, or on the deep, 1040 

Where he has enemies who lie in wait 
To slay him ere he reach his home again." 

And then the shadowy image spake again : — 
" Be of good courage ; let not fear o'ercome 
Thy spirit, for there goes with him a guide 1045 

Such as all others would desire to have 
Beside them ever, trusting in her power, — 
Pallas Athene, and she looks on thee 
With pity. From her presence I am sent, 
Her messenger, declaring this to thee." io S « 

Again discreet Penelope replied : — 
" If then thou be a goddess and hast heard 
A goddess speak these words, declare, I pray, 
Of that ill-fated one, if yet he live 
And look upon the sun, or else have died 105s 

And passed to the abodes beneath the earth." 

Once more the shadowy image spake : " Of him 
Will I say nothing, whether living yet 
Or dead ; no time is this for idle words." 

She said, and from the chamber glided forth 1060 
Beside the bolt, and mingled with the winds. 
Then quickly from her couch of sleep arose 
The daughter of Icarius, for her heart 
Was glad, so plainly had the dream conveyed 
Its message in the stillness of the night. 1065 

Meanwhile the suitors on their ocean-path 
Went in their galley, plotting cruelly 



ioo The Odyssey. 

To slay Telemachus. A rocky isle 

Far in the middle sea, between the coast 

Of Ithaca and craggy Samos, lies, i 

Named Asteris ; of narrow bounds, yet there 

A sheltered haven is to which two straits 

Give entrance. There the Achaians lay in wait.
