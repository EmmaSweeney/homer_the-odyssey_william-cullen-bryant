ULYSSES, the sagacious, answered thus : — 
" O King Alcinoiis, most renowned of men \ 
A. pleasant thing it is to hear a bard 
Like this, endowed with such a voice, so like 
The voices of the gods. Nor can I deem 5 

Aught more delightful than the general joy 
Of a whole people when the assembled guests 
Seated in order in the royal halls 
Are listening to the minstrel, while the board 
Is spread with bread and meats, and from the jars 10 
The cupbearer draws wine and fills the cups. 
To me there is no more delightful sight. 

" But now thy mind is moved to ask of me 
The story of the sufferings I have borne, 
And that will wake my grief anew. What first, is 
What next, shall I relate ? what last of all ? 
For manifold are the misfortunes cast 
Upon me by the immortals. Let me first 
Declare my name, that ye may know, and I 
Perchance, before my day of death shall come, » 
May be your host, though dwelling far away. 
I am Ulysses, and my father's name 
Laertes ; widely am I known to men 
As quick in shrewd devices, and my fame 
Hath reached to heaven. In sunny Ithaca *s 

I dwell, where high Neritus, seen afar. 



Book IX. 17; 

Rustles with woods. Around are many isles, 

Well peopled, near each other. Samos there 

Lies, with Dulichium, and Zacynthus dark 

With forests. Ithaca, with its low shores, 3c 

Lies highest toward the setting sun ; the rest 

Are on the side where first the morning breaks. 

A rugged region 't is, but nourishes 

Nobly its youths, nor have I ever seen 

A sweeter spot on earth. Calypso late, 35 

That glorious goddess, in her grotto long 

Detained me from it, and desired that I 

Should be her husband ; in her royal home 

^Eean Circe, mistress of strange arts, 

Detained me also, and desired that I <*. 

Should be her husband, — yet they could not 

move 
The purpose of my heart. For there is naught 
More sweet and dear than our own native land 
And parents, though perchance our lot be cast 
In a rich home, yet far from our own kin « 

And \^\ a foreign land. Now let me speak 
Of the calamitous voyage which the will 
Of Jove ordained on my return from Troy. 

" The. wind that blew me from the Trojan shore 
Bore me to the Ciconia<is, who abode 5 ( 

In Ismarus. I laid the city waste 
And slew its dwellers, carried off their wives 
And all their wealth and parted them among 
My men, that none might want an equal share. 
8* L 



1/8 The Odyssey. 

And then I warned them with all haste to leave 55 
The region. Madmen ! they obeyed me not. 

" And there they drank much wine, and on the 
beach 
Slew many sheep and many slow-paced steers 
With crumpled horns. Then the Ciconians called 
To their Ciconian neighbors, braver men 60 

Than they, and more in number, whose abode 
Was on the mainland, trained to fight from steeds, 
Or, if need were, on foot. In swarms they came, 
Thick as new leaves or morning flowers in spring. 
Then fell on our unhappy company 03 

An evil fate from Jove, and many griefs. 
They formed their lines, and fought at our good 

ships, 
Where man encountered man with brazen spears. 
While yet 't was morning, and the holy light 
Of day waxed brighter, we withstood the assault 70 
And kept our ground, although more numerous they. 
But when the sun was sloping toward the west 
The enemy prevailed ; the Achaian band 
Was routed, and was made to flee. That day 
There perished from each galley of our fleet 75 

Six valiant men ; the rest escaped with life. 

" Onward we sailed, lamenting bitterly 
Our comrades slain, yet happy to escape 
From death ourselves. Nor did we put to sea 
In our good ships until we thrice had called k 

Aloud by name each one of our poor friends 



Book IX. 179 

Who fell in battle by Ciconian bar ds. 
The Cloud-compeller, Jove, against us sent 
The north-wind in a hurricane, and wrapped 
The earth and heaven in clouds, and from the skies s s 
Fell suddenly the night. With stooping masts 
Our galleys scudded ; the strong tempest split 
And tore the sails ; we drew and laid them down 
Within the ships, in fear of utter wreck, 
And toward the mainland eagerly we turned 90 

The rudders. There we lay two days and nights, 
Worn out with grief and hardship. When at length 
The fair-haired Morning brought the third day round, 
We raised the masts, and, spreading the white sails 
To take the wind, we sat us down. The wind 9s 
Carried us forward with the pilot's aid : 
And then should I have reached my native land 
Safely, had not the currents and the waves 
Of ocean and the north-wind driven me back, 
What time I strove to pass Maleia's cape, 100 

And swept me to Cytherae from my course. 

" Still onward driven before those baleful winds 
Across the fishy deep for nine whole days, 
On the tenth day we reached the land where dwell 
The Lotus-eaters, men whose food is flowers. 105 
We landed on the mainland, and our crews 
Near the fleet galleys took their evening meal. 
And when we all had eaten and had drunk 
I sent explorers forth — two chosen men, 
A herald was the third — to learn what race uq 



180 The Odyssey, 

Of mortals nourished by the fruits of earth 

Possessed the land. They went and found themselves 

Among the Lotus-eaters soon, who used 

No violence against their lives, but gave 

Into their hands the lotus plant to taste. us 

Whoever tasted once of that sweet food 

Wished not to see his native country more, 

Nor give his friends the knowledge of his fate. 

And then my messengers desired to dwell 

Among the Lotus-eaters, and to feed iao 

Upon the lotus, never to return. 

By force I led them weeping to the fleet, 

And bound them in the hollow ships beneath 

The benches. Then I ordered all the rest 

Of my beloved comrades to embark 125 

In haste, lest, tasting of the lotus, they 

Should think no more of home. All straightway went 

On board, and on the benches took their place, 

And smote the hoary ocean with their oars. 

"Onward we sailed with sorrowing hearts, and 
reached ^30 

The country of the Cyclops, an untamed 
And lawless race, who, trusting to the gods, 
Plant not, nor plough the fields, but all things spring 
For them untended, — barley, wheat, and vines 
Yielding large clusters filled with wine, and nursed 13s 
By showers from Jove. No laws have they ; they hold 
No councils. On the mountain heights they dwell 
In vaulted caves, where each one rules his wives 






Book IX, 181 

And children as he pleases ; none give heed 

To what the others do. Before the port 140 

Of that Cyclopean land there is an isle, 

Low-lying, neither near nor yet remote, — 

A woodland region, where the wild goats breed 

Innumerable ; for the foot of man 

Disturbs them not, and huntsmen toiling through 143 

Thick woods, or wandering over mountain heights, 

Enter not here. The fields are never grazed 

By sheep, nor furrowed by the plough, but lie 

Untilled, unsown, and uninhabited 

By man, and only <eed the bleating goats. is* 

The Cyclops have no barks with crimson prows, 

Nor shipwrights "skilled to frame a galley's deck 

With benches for the rowers, and equipped 

For any service, voyaging by turns 

To all the cities, as is often done 155 

By men who cross the deep from place to place, 

And make a prosperous region of an isle. 

No meagre soil is there ; it well might bear 

All fruits in their due time. Along the shore 

Of the gray deep are meadows smooth and moist. 160 

The vine would flourish long ; the ploughman's task 

Is easy, and the husbandman would reap 

Large harvests, for the mould is rich below. 

And there is a safe haven, where no need 

Of cable is ; no anchor there is cast, 165 

Nor hawsers fastened to the strand, but they 

Who enter there remain until it please 



1 82 The Odyssey. 

The mariners, with favorable wind, 

To put to sea again. A limpid stream 

Flows from a fount beneath a hollow rock i 7 c 

Into that harbor at its further end, 

And poplars grow around it. Thither went 

Our fleet ; some deity had guided us 

Through the dark night, for nothing had we seen. 

Thickwas the gloom around our barks ; the moon 17s 

Shone not in heaven, the clouds had quenched her 

light. 
No eye discerned the isle, nor the long waves 
That rolled against the shore, till our good ships 
Touched land, and, disembarking there, we gave 
Ourselves to sleep upon the water-side i&> 

And waited for the holy Morn to rise. 

" And when at length the daughter of the Dawn, 
The rosy-fingered Morn, appeared, we walked 
Around the isle, admiring as we went. 
Meanwhile the nymphs, the daughters of the God 185 
Who bears the aegis, roused the mountain goats, 
That so our crews might make their morning meal. 
And straightway from our ships we took in hand 
Our crooked bows and our long-bladed spears. 

" ' Let all the rest of my beloved friends 190 

Remain, while I, with my own bark and crew, 
Go forth to learn what race of men are these, 
Whether ill-mannered, savage, and unjust, 
Or kind to guests and reverent toward the gods.' 

" I spake, and, having ordered all my crew 195 



Book IX. 183 

To go on board and cast the hawsers loose, 

Embarked on my own ship. They all obeyed, 

And manned the benches, sitting there in rows, 

And smote the hoary ocean with their oars. 

But when we came upon that neighboring coast, **» 

We saw upon its verge beside the sea 

A cave high vaulted, overbrowed with shrubs 

Of laurel. There much cattle lay at rest, 

Both sheep and goats. Around it was a court, 

A high enclosure of hewn stone, and pines 20s 

Tali stemmed, and towering oaks. Here dwelt a 

man 
Of giant bulk, who by himself, alone, 
Was wont to tend his flocks. He never held 
Converse with others, but devised apart 
His wicked deeds. A frightful prodigy w 

Was he, and like no man who lives by bread, 
But more like a huge mountain summit, rough 
With woods, that towers alone above the rest. 

" Then, bidding all the others stay and guard 
The ship, I chose among my bravest men 21s 

Twelve whom I took with me. I had on board 
A goatskin of dark wine, — a pleasant sort, 
Which Maron late, Evanthes' son, a priest 
Of Phoebus, guardian god of Ismarus, 
Gave me, when, moved with reverence, we saved ™ 
Him and his children and his wife from death. 
For his abode was in the thick-grown grove 
Of Phoebus. Costly were the gifts he gave, — 



184 The Odyssey. 

Seven talents of wrought gold ; a chalice all 

Of silver ; and he drew for me, besides, 22 

Into twelve jars, a choice rich wine, unspoiled 

By mixtures, and a beverage for gods. Y- 

No one within his dwellings, maids or men, 

Knew of it, save the master and his wife, 

And matron of the household. Whensoe'er a* 

They drank this rich red wine, he only filled 

A single cup with wine, and tempered that 

With twenty more of water. From the cup 

Arose a fragrance that might please the gods, 

And hard it was to put the draught aside. 233 

Of this I took a skin well filled, besides 

Food in a hamper, — for my thoughtful mind 

Misgave me, lest I should encounter one 

Of formidable strength and savage mood, 

And with no sense of justice or of right. 240 

" Soon were we at the cave, but found not him 
Within it ; he was in the fertile meads, 
Tending his flocks* We entered, wondering much 
At all we saw. Around were baskets heaped 
With cheeses ; pens were thronged with lambs and 
kids, 24s 

Each in a separate fold ; the elder ones, 
The younger, and the newly yeaned, had each 
Their place apart. The vessels swam with whey, — 
Pails smoothly wrought, and buckets into which 
He milked the cattle. My companions then *s> 
Begged me with many pressing words to take 



Book IX. 185 

Part of the cheeses, and, returning, drive 

With speed to our good galley lambs and kids 

From where they stabled, and set sail again 

On the salt sea. I granted not their wish ; ass 

Far better if I had. 'T was my intent 

To see the owner of the flocks and prove 

His hospitality. No pleasant sight 

Was that to be for those with whom I came. 

" And then we lit a fire, and sacrificed, »& 

And ate the cheeses, and within the cave 
Sat waiting, till from pasturing his flocks 
He came ; a heavy load of well-dried wood 
He bore, to make a blaze at supper-time. 
Without the den he flung his burden down 265 

With such a crash that we in terror slunk 
Into a corner of the cave. He drove 
His well-fed flock, all those whose milk he drew, 
Under that spacious vault of rock, but left 
The males, both goats and rams, without the court. 270 
And then he lifted a huge barrier up, 
A mighty weight ; not two-and-twenty wains, 
Four-wheeled and strong, could move it from the 

ground : 
Such was the enormous rock he raised, and placed 
Against the entrance. Then he sat and milked 27s 
The ewes and bleating goats r each one in turn, 
And gave to each its young. Next, half the milk 
He caused to curdle, and disposed the curd 
In woven baskets ; and the other half 



1 86 The Odyssey. 

He kept in bowls to be his evening drink. ** 

His tasks all ended thus, he lit a fire, 

And saw us where we lurked, and questioned us : — 

" ' Who are ye, strangers ? Tell me whence ye 
came 
Across the ocean. Are ye men of trade, 
Or wanderers at will, like those who roam *8 S 

The sea for plunder, and, with their own lives 
In peril, carry death to distant shores?' 

" He spake, and we who heard with sinking hearts 
Trembled at that deep voice and frightful form, 
And thus I answered : ' We are Greeks who come 29a 
From Ilium, driven across the mighty deep 
By changing winds, and while we sought our home 
Have made a different voyage, and been forced 
Upon another course ; such was the will 
Of Jupiter. We boast ourselves to be 29s 

Soldiers of Agamemnon, Atreus' son, 
Whose fame is now the greatest under heaven, 
So mighty was the city which he sacked, 
So many were the warriors whom he slew ; 
And now we come as suppliants to thy knees, 300 
And ask thee to receive us as thy guests, 
Or else bestow the gifts which custom makes 
The stranger's due. Great as thou art, revere 
The gods ; for suitors to thy grace are we, 
And hospitable Jove, whose presence goes 30s 

With every worthy stranger, will avenge 
Suppliants and strangers when they suffer wrong.' 



Book IX. 187 

" I spake, and savagely he answered me : — 
'Thou art a fool, O stranger, or art come 
From some far country, — thou who biddest me 310 
Fear or regard the gods. We little care — 
We Cyclops — for the ^Egis-bearer, Jove, 
Or any other of the blessed gods ; 
We are their betters. Think not I would spare 
Thee or thy comrades to avoid the wrath 315 

Of Jupiter, unless it were my choice ; 
But say, — for I would know, — where hast thou left 
Thy gallant bark in landing ? was it near, 
Or in some distant corner of the isle ? ' 

" He spake to tempt me, but I well perceived 320 
His craft, and answered with dissembling words : — 

" ' Neptune, who shakes the shores, hath wrecked 
my bark 
On rocks that edge thine island, hurling it 
Against the headland. From the open sea 
The tempest swept it hitherward, and I, 32s 

With these, escaped the bitter doom of death.' 

" I spake ; the savage answered not, but sprang, 
And, laying hands on my companions, seized 
Two, whom he dashed like whelps against the 

ground. 
Their brains flowed out, and weltered where they feil. 
He hewed them limb from limb for his repast, 3p 
And, like a lion of the mountain wilds, 
Devoured them as they were, and left no part, — 
Entrails nor flesh nor marrowy bones. We wept 



1 88 The Odyssey. 

To see his cruelties, and raised our hands 335 

To Jove, and hopeless misery filled our hearts. 
And when the Cyclops now had filled himself, 
Devouring human flesh, and drinking milk 
Unmingled, in his cave he laid him down, 
Stretched out amid his flocks. The thought arose 340 
In my courageous heart to go to him, 
And draw the trenchant sword upon my thigh, 
And where the midriff joins the liver deal 
A stroke to pierce his breast. A second thought 
Restrained me, — that a miserable death 34s 

Would overtake us, since we had no power 
To move the mighty rock which he had laid 
At the high opening. So all night we grieved, 
Waiting the holy Morn ; and when at length 
That rosy-fingered daughter of the Dawn 350 

Appeared, the Cyclops lit a fire, and milked 
His fair flock one by one, and brought their young 
Each to its mother's side. When he had thus 
Performed his household tasks, he seized again 
Two of our number for his morning meal. 3- 

These he devoured, and then he moved away 
With ease the massive rock that closed the cave, 
And, driving forth his well-fed flock, he laid 
The massive barrier back, as one would fit 
The lid upon a quiver. With loud noise 3* 

The Cyclops drove that well-fed flock afield, 
While I was left to think of many a plan 
To do him mischief and avenge our wrongs, 



Book IX. 189 

If haply Pallas should confer on me 

That glory. To my mind, as I revolved «* 

The plans, this seemed the wisest of them all 

" Beside the stalls there lay a massive club 
Of olive-wood, yet green, which from its stock 
The Cyclops hewed, that he might carry it 
When seasoned. As it lay it seemed to us 37c 

The mast of some black galley, broad of beam, 
With twenty oarsmen, built to carry freight 
Across the mighty deep, — such was its length 
And thickness. Standing by it, I cut off 
A fathom's length, and gave it to my men, 37s 

And bade them smooth its sides, and they obeyed 
While I made sharp the smaller end, and brought 
The point to hardness in the glowing fire ; 
And then I hid the weapon in a heap 
Of litter, which lay thick about the cave. 380 

I bade my comrades now decide by lot 
Which of them all should dare, along with me, 
To lift the stake, and with its point bore out 
Our enemy's eye, when softly wrapped in sleep. 
The lot was cast, and fell on those whom most 38s 
I wished with me, — four men, and I the fifth. 

" At eve the keeper of these fair-woolled flocks 
Returned, and brought his well-fed sheep and goats 
Into the spacious cavern, leaving none 
Without it, whether through some doubt of us 39* 
Or through the ordering of some god. He raised 
The massive rock again, and laid it close 



I go The Odyssey. 

Against the opening. Then he sat and milked 
The ewes and bleating goats f each one in turn, 
And gave to each her young. When he had thus 395 
Performed his household tasks, he seized again 
Two of our number for his evening meal. 
Then drew I near, and bearing in my hand 
A wooden cup of dark red wine I said : — 

" ' Take this, O Cyclops, after thy repast 400 

Of human flesh, and drink, that thou mayst know 
What liquor was concealed within our ship. 
I brought it as an offering to thee, 
For I had hope that thou wouldst pity us, 
And send us home. Yet are thy cruelties 405 

Beyond all limit. Wicked as thou art, 
Hereafter who, of all the human race, . 
Will dare approach thee, guilty of such wrong ? ' 

" As thus I spake, he took the cup and drank. 
The luscious wine delighted mightily 410 

His palate, and he asked a second draught. 

" e Give me to drink again, and generously, 
And tell thy name, that I may make a gift 
Such as becomes a host. The fertile land 
In which the Cyclops dwell yields wine, 't is true, 41s 
And the large grapes are nursed by rains from Jove, 
But nectar and ambrosia are in this.' 

" He spake ; I gave him of the generous juice 
Again, and thrice I filled and brought the cup, 
And thrice the Cyclops in his folly drank. **i 

But when I saw the wine begin to cloud 



Book IX. 191 

His senses, I bespake him blandly thus : — 

" ' Thou hast inquired, O Cyclops, by what name 
Men know me. I will tell thee, but do thou 
Bestow in turn some hospitable gift, 42s 

As thou hast promised. Noman is my name, 
My father and my mother gave it me, 
And Noman am I called by all my friends.' 
"I ended, and he answered savagely : — 
1 Noman shall be the last of all his band 430 

Whom I will eat, the rest will I devour 
Before him. Let that respite be my gift.' 

" He spake, and, sinking backward at full length, 
Lay on the ground, with his huge neck aside ; 
All-powerful sleep had overtaken him. 435 

Then from his mouth came bits of human flesh 
Mingled with wine, and from his drunken throat 
Rejected noisily. I put the stake 
Among the glowing coals to gather heat, 
And uttered cheerful words, encouraging 440 

My men, that none might fail me through their fears. 
And when the olive-wood began to blaze, — 
For though yet green it freely took the lire, — 
I drew it from the embers. Round me stood 
My comrades, whom some deity inspired 445 

With calm, high courage. In their hands they took 
And thrust into his eye the pointed bar, 
While perched upon a higher stand than they 
I twirled it round. As when a workman bores 
Some timber of a ship, the men who stand 450 



192 The Odyssey. 

Below him with a strap, on either side 

Twirl it, and round it spins unceasingly, 

So, thrusting in his eye that pointed bar, 

We made it turn. The blood came streaming forth 

On the hot wood ; the eyelids and the brow 45s 

Were scalded by the vapor, and the roots 

Of the scorched eyeball crackled with the fire. 

As when a smith, in forging axe or adze, 

Plunges, to temper it, the hissing blade 

Into cold water, strengthening thus the steel, 460 

So hissed the eyeball of the Cyclops round 

That olive stake. He raised a fearful howl ; 

The rocks rang with it, and we fled from him 

In terror. Plucking from his eye the stake 

All foul and dripping with the abundant blood, 465 

He flung it madly from him with both hands. 

Then called he to the Cyclops who in grots 

Dwelt on that breezy height. They heard his 

voice 
And came by various ways, and stood beside 
The cave, and asked the occasion of his grief. 470 

" ' What hurts thee, Polyphemus, that thou thus 
Dost break our slumbers in the ambrosial night 
With cries ? Hath any of the sons of men 
Driven off thy flocks in spite of thee, or tried 
By treachery or force to take thy life ? ' 475 

" Huge Polyphemus answered from his den : — 
1 O friends ! 't is Noman who is killing me ; 
By treachery Noman kills me ; none by force/ 



Book IX. 193 

"Then thus with winged words they spake again : — 
a If no man does thee violence, and thou 4& 

Art quite alone, reflect that none escape 
Diseases ; they are sent by Jove. But make 
Thy prayer to Father Neptune, ocean's king.' 

" So spake they and departed. In my heart 
I laughed to think that by the name I took, 48s 

And by my shrewd device, I had deceived 
The Cyclops. Meantime, groaning and in pain, 
And groping with his hands, he moved away 
The rock that barred the entrance. There he sat, 
With arms outstretched, to seize whoever sought w 
To issue from the cavern with the flock, 
So dull of thought he deemed me. Then I planned 
How best to save my comrades and myself 
From death. I framed a thousand stratagems 
And arts, — for here was life at stake, and great 495 
The danger was. At last I fixed on this. 

" The rams were plump and beautiful, and large 
With thick dark fleeces. These I silently 
Bound to each other, three and three, with twigs 
Of which that prodigy of lawless guilt, 500 

The Cyclops, made his bed. The middle ram 
Of every three conveyed a man ; the two, 
One on each side, were there to make him safe. 
Thus each of us was borne by three ; but I 
Chose for myself the finest one of all, 5* 

And seized him by the back, and, slipping down 
Beneath his shaggy belly, stretched myself 

VOL. I. 9 M 



194 The Odyssey. 

At length, and clung with resolute heart, and hands 
That firmly clenched the rich abundant fleece. 
Then sighed we for the holy Morn to rise. s*> 

" And when again the daughter of the Dawn, 
The rosy-fingered Morn, looked forth, the males 
Went forth to pasture, while the ewes remained 
Within the stables, bleating, yet unmilked, 
For heavy were their udders. Carefully sis 

The master handled, though in grievous pain, 
The back of every one that rose and passed, 
Yet, slow of thought, perceived not that my men 
Were clinging hid beneath their woolly breasts. 
As the last ram of all the flock went out, 5* 

His thick fleece heavy with my weight, and I 
In agitated thought, he felt his back, 
And thus the giant Polyphemus spake : — 

" ' My favorite ram, how art thou now the last 
To leave the cave ? It hath not been thy wont 525 
To let the sheep go first, but thou didst come 
Earliest to feed among the flowery grass, 
Walking with stately strides, and thou wert first 
At the fresh stream, and first at eve to seek 
The stable ; now thou art the last of all. 530 

Grievest thou for thy master, who has lost 
His eye, put out by a deceitful wretch 
And his vile crew, who stupefied me first 
With wine, — this Noman, — who, if right I deem, 
Has not escaped from death. O, didst thou think 53s 
A.s I do, and hadst but the power of speech 



BOOk IX. IQi» 

To tell me where he hides from my strong arm, 
Then should his brains, dashed out against the ground, 
Be scattered here and there • then should my heart 
Be somewhat lighter, even amid the woes 540 

Which Noman, worthless wretch, has brought on 

me!' 
" He spake, and sent him forth among the rest ; 
And when we v/ere a little way beyond 
The cavern and the court, I loosed my hold 
Upon the animal and unbound my men. 54s 

Then quickly we surrounded and drove off, 
Fat sheep and stately paced, a numerous flock, 
And brought them to our ship, where joyfully 
Our friends received us, though with grief and tears 
For those who perished. Yet I suffered not 55c 
That they should weep, but, frowning, gave command 
By signs to lift with speed the fair-woolled sheep* 
On board, and launch our ship on the salt sea. 
They went on board, where each one took his 

place 
Upon the benches, and with diligent oars 555 

Smote the gray deep ; and when we were as far 
As one upon the shore could hear a shout, 
Thus to the Cyclops tauntingly I called : — 

" l Ha ! Cyclops ! those whom in thy rocky cave 
Thou, in thy brutal fury, hast devoured, s<* 

Were friends of one not unexpert in war ; 
Amply have thy own guilty deeds returned 
Upon thee. Cruel one ! who didst not tear 



196 The Odyssey. 

To eat the strangers sheltered by thy roof, 

Jove and the other gods avenge them thus.* 56s 

" I spake ; the anger in his bosom raged 
More fiercely. From a mountain peak he wrenched 
Its summit, hurling it to fall beside 
Our galley, where it almost touched the helm. 
The rock dashed high the water where it fell, <n* 
And the returning billow swept us back 
And toward the shore. I seized a long-stemmed pike 
And pushed it from the shore, encouraging 
The men to bend with vigor to their oars 
And so escape. With nods I gave the sign. 575 

Forward to vigorous strokes the oarsmen leaned 
Till we were out at sea as far from land 
As when I spake before, and then again 
I shouted to the Cyclops, though my crew 
Strove to prevent it with beseeching words, 580 

And one man first and then another said : — 

" ' O most unwise ! why chafe that savage man 
To fury, — him who just has cast his bolt 
Into the sea, and forced us toward the land 
Where we had wellnigh perished ? Should he hear 58s 
A cry from us, or even a word of speech, 
Then would he fling a rock to crush our heads 
And wreck our ship, so fatal is his cast.' 

" He spake, but moved not my courageous heart ; 
And then I spake again, and angrily : — 590 

" ' Cyclops, if any man of mortal birth 
Note thine unseemly blindness, and inquire 



Book IX. 197 

The occasion, tell him that Laertes' son, 

Ulysses, the destroyer of walled towns, 

Whose home is Ithaca, put out thine eye.' 59s 

" I spake ; he answered with a wailing voice : — 
1 Now, woe is me ! the ancient oracles 
Concerning me have come to pass. Here dwelt 
A seer named Telemus Eurymides, 
Great, good, and eminent in prophecy, 000 

And prophesying he grew old among 
The Cyclops. He foretold my coming fate, — - 
That I should lose my sight, and by the hand 
And cunning of Ulysses. Yet I looked 
For one of noble presence, mighty strength, 60s 

And giant stature landing on our coast. 
Now a mere weakling, insignificant 
And small of stature, has put out my eye, 
First stupefying me with wine. Yet come 
Hither, I pray, Ulysses, and receive 610 

The hospitable gifts which are thy due ; 
And I will pray to Neptune, and entreat 
The mighty god to guide thee safely home. 
His son am I, and he declares himself 
My father. He can heal me if he will, «is 

And no one else of all the immortal gods 
Or mortal men can give me back my sight/ 

" He spake ; I answered : ' Rather would I take 
Thy life and breath, and send thee to the abode 
Of Hades, where thou wouldst be past the power °2<> 
Of even Neptune to restore thine eye.' 



198 The Odyssey. 

" As thus I said, the Cyclops raised his hands, 
And spread them toward the starry heaven, and thus 
Prayed to the deity who rules the deep : — 

" ' Hear, dark-haired Neptune, who dost swathe 
the earth ! &* 

If I am thine, and thou dost own thyself 
My father, grant that this Ulysses ne'er 
May reach his native land ! But if it be 
The will of fate that he behold again 
His friends, and enter his own palace-halls 630 

In his own country, late and sorrowful 
Be his return, with all his comrades lost, 
And in a borrowed ship, and may he find 
In his own home new griefs awaiting him.' 

" He prayed, and Neptune hearkened to his 
prayer. 6 3S 

And then the Cyclops seized another stone, 
Far larger than the last, and swung it round, 
And cast it with vast strength. It fell behind 
Our black-prowed galley, where it almost struck 
The rudder's end. The sea was dashed on high e* 
Beneath the falling rock, and bore our ship 
On toward the shore we sought. When we reached 
The island where together in a fleet 
Our other galleys lay, we found our friends 
Sitting where they had waited long in grief. e 4 s 

We touched the shore and drew our galley up 
On the smooth sand, and stepped upon the beach j 
And taking from on board the sheep that formed 



Book X. 199 

Part of the Cyclops' flock, divided them, 

That none might be without an equal share. *& 

When all the rest were shared, my warrior friends 

Decreed the ram to me. Of him I made 

Upon the beach a sacrifice to Jove 

The Cloud-compeller, Saturn's son, whose rule 

Is over all ; to him I burned the thighs. 655 

He heeded not the offering ; even then 

He planned the wreck of all my gallant ships, 

And death of my dear comrades. All that day 

Till set of sun we sat and feasted high 

Upon the abundant meats and delicate wine. 660 

But when the sun went down, and darkness crept 

Over the earth, we slumbered on the shore ; 

And when again the daughter of the Dawn, 

The rosy-fingered Morn, looked forth, I called 

My men with cheerful words to climb the decks 665 

And cast the hawsers loose. With speed they went 

On board and manned the benches, took in hand 

The oars and smote with them the hoary deep. 

Onward in sadness, glad to have escaped, 

We sailed, yet sorrowing for our comrades lost."
