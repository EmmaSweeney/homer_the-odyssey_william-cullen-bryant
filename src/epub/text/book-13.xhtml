HE spake, and all within those shadowy halls 
Were silent ; all were held in mute delight. 
Alcinoiis then took up the word and said : — 

" Since thou hast come, Ulysses, as a guest, 
To this high pile and to these brazen rooms, 
So long a sufferer, thou must not depart 
Upon thy homeward way a wanderer still. 
And this let me enjoin on each of you 
Who in this palace drink at our repasts 
The choice red wine, and listen to the bard : m 

Already in a polished chest are laid 
Changes of raiment, works of art in gold, 
And other gifts, which the Phaeacian chiefs 
Have destined for our guest ; now let us each 
Bestow an ample tripod and a vase, 15 

And we in an assembly of the realm 
Will see the cost repaid, since otherwise 
Great would the burden be that each must bear." 
So spake Alcinoiis ; they approved, and sought 
vol. 11. i A 



2 The Odyssey. 

Their homes to sleep, but when the child of Dawn, »> 
The rosy-fingered Morn, appeared, they came, 
All bringing to the ship their gifts of brass 
In honor of the guest. The mighty prince 
Alcinoiis, going through the ship, bestowed 
The whole beneath the benches, that no one 2s 

Of those who leaned to pull the oar might thence 
Meet harm or hindrance. Then they all went back 
To the king's palace, and prepared a feast. 

The mighty prince Alcinoiis offered up 
For them an ox to cloud-compelling Jove, 30 

The son of Saturn, ruler over all. 
They burned the thighs, and held high festival, 
And all was mirth. Divine Demodocus 
The bard, whom all men reverenced, sang to them. 
Meantime Ulysses often turned to look 35 

At the bright Sun, and longed to see him set, 
So eager was the hero to set sail 
Upon his homeward way. As when a swain 
Awaits his evening meal, for whom all day 
Two dark-brown steers have dragged the solid 
plough 40 

Through fallow grounds, and welcome is the hour 
Of sunset, calling him to his repast, 
And wearily he walks with failing knees, 
So welcome to Ulysses did the light 
Of day go down. Then did he hold discourse 45 
With the Phaeacians, lovers of the sea, 
And chiefly with Alcinoiis, speaking thus :-= 



Book XIII. 3 

" O monarch most illustrious of thy race, 
Alcinoiis, now when ye have duly poured 
Wine to the gods, be pleased to send me hence * 
In peace, and fare ye well ! All that my heart 
Could wish have ye provided bounteously, — 
An escort and rich gifts ; and may the gods 
Bestow their blessing with them ! May I meet 
My blameless wife again, and find my friends ss 
Prosperous ! And ye whom I shall leave behind, 
Long may ye make the wives of your young years 
And children happy ! May the gods vouchsafe 
To crown with every virtue you and them, 
And may no evil light upon your isle ! " <*> 

He spake ; the assembly all approved his words, 
And bade send forth the stranger on his way, 
Who spake so nobly. Then the mighty prince 
Alcinoiis turned, and to the herald said : — 

" Now mix the wine, Pontonoiis, in a jar, 6s 

And bear a part to all beneath our roof, 
That we with prayers to Father Jupiter 
May send the stranger to his native land." 

He spake ; Pontonoiis mingled for the guests 
The generous wine, and went with it to each, 7c 
Who poured it on the ground, from where they sat, 
To all the dwellers of the ample heaven ; 
And then the great Ulysses, rising up, 
Placed the round goblet in Arete's hands, 
And thus bespake the queen with winged words : — n 

" Farewell, O queen, through the long years, till 
age 



4 The Odyssey. 

And death, which are the lot of all, shall come. 
Now I depart, but mayst thou, here among 
Thy people, and the children of thy love, 
And King Alcinoiis, lead a happy life ! " * 

So spake the high-born chieftain, and withdrew, 
And crossed the threshold. King Alcinoiis sent 
A herald with him to direct his way 
To the fleet ship and border of the deep. 
Arete also sent her servant-maids, — 8= 

One bearing a fresh cloak and tunic, one 
A coffer nobly wrought, and yet a third 
Bread and red wine; and when they reached the ship 
Beside the sea, the diligent crew received 
Their burdens, and bestowed within the hold 9» 
The food and drink, but spread upon the deck 
And at the stern a mat and linen sheet, 
That there Ulysses undisturbed might sleep. 
He went on board and silently lay down, 
While all the rowers in due order took 95 

Their seats upon the benches. Loosing first 
The hawser from the perforated rock, 
They bent them to their task, and flung the brine 
Up from the oar, while on the chieftain's lids 
Lighted a sweet and deep and quiet sleep, ™ 

Most like to death. As, smitten by the lash, 
Four harnessed stallions spring on high and dart 
Across the plain together ; so the prow 
Rose leaping forward, while behind it rolled 
A huge dark billow of the roaring sea. 103 



Book XIII. 5 

Safely and steadily the galley ran, 

Nor could a falcon, swiftest of the birds, 

Have kept beside it, with such speed it flew, 

Bearing a hero who was like the gods 

In wisdom, and whose sufferings in the wars «o 

And voyages among the furious waves 

Were great and many, though he slumbered now 

In peace, forgetful of misfortunes past. 

Now when that brightest star, the harbinger 
Of Morning, daughter of the Dawn, arose, us 

The bark had passed the sea, and reached the isle. 

A port there is in Ithaca, the haunt 
Of Phorcys, Ancient of the Sea. Steep shores 
Stretch inward toward each other, and roll back 
The mighty surges which the hoarse winds hurl i» 
Against them from the ocean, while within 
Ships ride without their hawsers when they once 
Have passed the haven's mouth. An olive-tree 
With spreading branches at the farther end 
Of that fair haven stands, and overbrows 12s 

A pleasant shady grotto of the nymphs 
Called Naiads. Cups and jars of stone are ranged 
Within, and bees lay up their honey there. 
There from their spindles wrought of stone the 

nymphs 
Weave their sea-purple robes, which all behold 130 
With wonder ; there are ever-flowing springs. 
Two are the entrances : one toward the north 
By which men enter ; but a holier one 



6 The Odyssey. 

Looks toward the south, nor ever mortal foot 
May enter there. By that way pass the gods. 13s 

They touched the land, for well they knew the spot. 
The galley, urged so strongly by the arms 
Of those who plied the oar, ran up the beach 
Quite half her length. And then the crew came forth 
From the good ship, and first they lifted out 140 

Ulysses with the linen and rich folds 
Of tapestry, and laid him on the sands 
In a deep slumber. Then they also took 
The presents from the hold, which, as he left 
Their isle, the princes of Phaeacia gave 145 

By counsel of wise Pallas. These they piled 
Close to the olive-tree, without the way, 
That none, in passing, ere Ulysses woke, 
Might do their owner wrong. Then homeward 

sailed 
The crew ; but Neptune, who could not forge* 150 
The threats which he had uttered long before 
Against the godlike chief Ulysses, thus 
Sought to explore the will of Jupiter : — 

" O Father Jove ! I shall no more be held 
In honor with the gods, since mortal men, 15s 

The people of Phaeacia, though their race 
Is of my lineage, do not honor me. 
I meant Ulysses should not reach his home 
Save with much suffering, though I never thoyght 
To hinder his return, for thou hadst given 100 

Thy promise and thy nod that it should be. 



Book XIII. 7 

Yet these Phaeacians, in a gallant bark, 

Have borne him o'er the deep, and while he slept, 

Have laid him down in Ithaca, and given 

Large gifts, abundant store of brass and gold, ^i 

And woven work, more than he could have brought 

From captured Ilium, if he had returned 

Safely, with all his portion of the spoil." 

Then cloud-compelling Jupiter replied : 
" Earth-shaker, ruler of a mighty realm ! 170 

What hast thou said ? The gods deny thee not 
Due honor ; perilous it were for them 
To show contempt for one who stands in age 
And might above them all. But if among 
The sons of men be one who puts such trust 17s 
In his own strength as not to honor thee, 
Do as seems good to thee, and as thou wilt." 

Promptly the god who shakes the shores replied \ 
" What thou dost bid me I would do at once, 
But that I fear and would avoid thy wrath. 180 

I would destroy that fair Phseacian bark 
In its return across the misty sea 
From bearing home Ulysses, that no more 
May the Phaeacians lend an escort thus 
To wandering men, and I would also cause 185 

A lofty mount to rise and hide their town." 

Then spake again the Cloud-compeller Jove : 
u Thus were it best, my brother : when the crowd 
Of citizens already see the ship 
Approaching, then transform it to a rock 190 



8 The Odyssey. 

In semblance of a galley, that they all 

May gaze in wonder ; thus wilt thou have caused 

A lofty mount to stand before their town." 

This when the shaker of the shores had heard, 
He flew to Scheria, the Phaeacian isle, 19s 

And stood, until that galley, having crossed 
The sea, came swiftly scudding. He drew near 
And smote it with his open palm, and made 
The ship a rock, fast rooted in the bed 
Of the deep sea, and then he went his way. 200 

Then winged words were spoken in that throng 
Of the Phaeacians, wielders of long oars, 
And far renowned in feats of seamanship. 
And, looking on each other, thus they said : — 

" Ha! what has stayed our good ship on the sea? 
This moment we beheld her hastening home." 206 

'T was thus they talked, unweeting of the cause. 
But then Alcinoiis to the assembly said : — 

" Yes ! now I call to mind the ancient words 
Of prophecy, — my father's, — who was wont 210 
To say that Neptune sorely is displeased 
That we should give to every man who comes 
Safe escort to his home. In coming times, — 
Such was my father's prophecy, — the god 
Would yet destroy a well-appointed bark «s 

Of the Phaeacians on the misty deep 
Returning from an escort, and would cause 
A lofty mount to stand before our town. 
So prophesied the aged man ; his words 



Book XIII. 9 

Are here fulfilled. Now do as I appoint, 22a 

And let us all obey. Henceforth refrain 

From bearing to their homes the strangers thrown 

Upon our coast ; and let us sacrifice 

To Neptune twelve choice bullocks of the herd, 

That he may pity us, nor hide our town 225 

With a huge mountain from the sight of men." 

He spake, and they were awed and straightway 
brought 
The bullocks for the sacrifice. So prayed 
To sovereign Neptune the Phaeacian chiefs 
And princes, standing round the altar-fires. 230 

Now woke the great Ulysses from his sleep 
In his own land, and yet he knew it not. 
Long had he been away, and Pallas now, 
The goddess-child of Jove, had cast a mist 
Around him, that he might not yet be known ^35 
To others, and that she might tell him first 
What he should learn ; nor even might his wife, 
Nor friends, nor people, know of his return, 
Ere he avenged upon the suitor crew 
His wrongs, and therefore all things wore to him 240 
Another look, — the footways stretching far, 
The bights where ships were moored, the towering 

rocks, 
And spreading trees. He rose and stood upright, 
And gazed upon his native coast and wept, 
And smote his thigh, and said in bitter grief: — ^ 

u Ah me ! what region am I in, among 
** 



IO The Odyssey. 

What people ? lawless, cruel, and unjust ? 

Or are they hospitable men, who fear 

The gods ? And where shall I bestow these goods, 

And whither go myself ? Would that they all 250 

Were still with the Phaeacians, and that I 

Had found some other great and mighty king 

Kindly to welcome me, and send me back 

To my own land. I know not where to place 

These treasures, and I must not leave them here, 255 

Lest others come and seize them as a spoil. 

Nay, these Phaeacian chiefs and counsellors 

Were not, in all things, either wise or just. 

They gave their word to land me on the coast 

Of pleasant Ithaca, and have not kept s<* 

Their promise. O, may Jove avenge this wrong! 

He who protects the suppliant, who beholds 

All men with equal eye, and punishes 

The guilty. Now will I review my stores 

And number them again, that I may see 265 

If those who left me here have taken aught." 

Thus having said, he numbered all his gifts. — 
Beautiful tripods, caldrons, works of gold, 
And gorgeous woven raiment ; none of these 
Were wanting. Then he pined to see again 270 

His native isle, and slowly paced the beach 
Of the loud sea, lamenting bitterly. 
There Pallas came to meet him in the shape 
Of a young shepherd, delicately formed, 
As are the sons of kings A mantle lay »?5 



Book XI I L II 

Upon her shoulder in rich folds ; her feet 

Shone in their sandals : in her hand she bore 

A javelin. As Ulysses saw, his heart 

Was glad within him, and he hastened on, 

And thus accosted her with winged words : — »% 

" Fair youth, who art the first whom I have met 
Upon this shore, I bid thee hail, and hope 
Thou meetest me with no unkind intent. 
Protect what thou beholdest here and me ; 
I make my suit to thee as to a god, 285 

And come to thy dear knees. And tell, I pray, 
That I may know the truth, what land is this ? 
What people? who the dwellers? may it be 
A pleasant isle, or is it but the shore 
Of fruitful mainland shelving to the sea ? " 29* 

And then the goddess, blue-eyed Pallas, said : 
" Of simple mind art thou, unless perchance 
Thou comest from afar, if thou dost ask 
What country this may be. It is not quite 
A nameless region ; many know it well 29s 

Of those who dwell beneath the rising sun, 
And those, behind, in Evening's dusky realm. 
Rugged it is, and suited ill to steeds, 
Yet barren it is not, though level grounds 
Are none within its borders. It is rich i°o 

In corn and wine, for seasonable rains 
And dews refresh its soil. Large flocks of goats 
A.nd herds of beeves are pastured here ; all kinds 
Of trees are in its forests, and its springs 



12 The Odyssey. 

Are never dry. The fame of Ithaca, *> 

Stranger, has travelled to the Trojan coast, 
Though that, I hear, lies far away from Greece." 

She spake ; Ulysses, the great sufferer, 
Rejoiced to be in his own land, whose name 
Pallas, the child of aegis-bearing Jove, 3* 

Had just now uttered. Then with winged words 
He spake, but not the truth ; his artful speech 
Put that aside, for ever in his breast 
The power of shrewd invention was awake : — 

" In the broad fields of Crete, that lie far off 3x3 
Beyond the sea, I heard of Ithaca, 
To which I now am come with these my goods. 
I left as many for my sons and fled, 
For Ihad slain Orsilochus, the fleet 
Of foot, the dear son of Idomeneus, 320 

Who overcame by swiftness in the race 
The foremost runners in the realm of Crete. 
He sought to rob me wholly of my share 
Of Trojan spoil, for which I had endured 
Hardships in war with heroes, and at sea 325 

Among the angry waves. The cause was this : 
I would not in the siege of Troy submit 
To serve his father, but, apart from him, 
I led a troop, companions of my own. 
The youth returning from the fields I met, 33* 

And smote him with the spear, — for near the way 
I lay in ambush with a single friend. 
A night exceeding dark was in the sky ; 



Book XIII. 13 

No human eye beheld, nor did he know 
Who took his life. When I had slain him thus 33s 
With the sharp spear I hastened to a ship 
Of the Phoenicians, and besought their aid, 
And gave them large reward, and bade them steer 
To Pylos, bearing me, and leave me there, 
Or where the Epeians hold the hallowed coast 3* 
-Of Elis. But the force of adverse winds 
Drove them unwilling thence; they meant no fraud. 
We wandered hither, just at night we came ; 
And rowing hard, the seamen brought their ship 
Within the port. No word was said of food, 345 
Though great our need. All disembarked in haste 
And lay upon the shore. Deep was the sleep 
That stole upon my weary limbs. The men 
Took from the hold my goods, and, bearing them 
To where I slumbered on the sand, set sail 350 

For populous Sidonia, leaving me 
Here quite alone with sorrow in my heart." 

He spake ; the blue-eyed goddess, Pallas, smiled, 
And touched the chief caressingly. She seemed 
A beautiful and stately woman now, 35s 

Such as are skilled in works of rare device, 
And thus she said to him in winged words : — 

" Full shrewd were he, a master of deceit, 
Who should surpass thee in the ways of craft, 
Even though he were a god, — thou unabashed 36* 
And prompt with shifts, and measureless in wiles I 
Thou canst not even in thine own land refrain 



14 The Odyssey. 

From artful figments and misleading words, 

As thou hast practised from thy birth. But now 

Speak we of other matters, for we both 365 

Are skilled in stratagem. Thou art the first 

Of living men in counsel and in speech, 

And I am famed for foresight and for craft 

Among the immortals. Dost thou not yet know 

Pallas Athene, child of Jove, whose aid 370 

Is present to defend thee in all time 

Of peril, and but lately gained for thee 

The favor of the whole Phaeacian race ? 

And hither am I come to frame for thee 

Wise counsels, and to hide away the stores 37s 

Given by the opulent Phaeacian chiefs 

At thy departure. I shall also tell 

What thou must yet endure beneath the roof 

Of thine own palace, by the will of fate. 

Yet bear it bravely, since thou must, nor speak 380 

To any man or woman of thyself 

And of thy wandering hither, but submit 

To many things that grieve thee, silently, 

And bear indignities from violent men." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, thus rejoined : 38s 

" O goddess, it is hard for mortal man 
To know thee when he meets thee, though his sight 
Be of the sharpest, for thou puttest on 
At pleasure any form. Yet this I know, 
That thou wert kind to me when we, the sons 3* 
Of Greece, were warring in the realm of Troy. 



Book XIII. 15 

But when we had o'erihrown the lofty town 

Of Priam, and embarked, and when some god 

Had scattered the Achaians, after that, 

Daughter of Jove, I never saw thee more, 395 

Never perceived thee entering my bark 

And guarding me from danger, — but I roamed 

Ever from place to place, my heart weighed down 

Bj" sorrow, till the gods delivered me, 

Aafl till thy counsels in the opulent realm 400 

Of'tfte Phaeacians brought my courage back, 

And thou thyself didst guide me to the town. 

And now in thy great father's name I pray, — 

For yet I cannot ^think that I am come 

To pleasant Ithaca, but have been thrown 405 

Upon some other coast, and fear that thou 

Art jesting with me, and hast spoken thus 

But to deceive me, — tell me, is it true 

That I am in my own beloved land ? " 

And then the goddess, blue-eyed Pallas, said : 410 
" Such ever are thy thoughts, and therefore I 
Must not forsake thee in thy need. I know 
How prompt thy speech, how quick thy thought, 

how shrewd 
Thy judgment. If another man had come 
From such long wanderings, he had flown at once 415 
Delighted to his children and his wife 
In his own home. But thou desirest not 
To ask or hear of them till thou hast put 
Thy consort to the trial of her truth, — 



1 6 The Odyssey. 

Her who now sits within thy halls and waits 4» 

In vain for thee, and in perpetual grief 

And weeping wears her nights and days away. 

I never doubted — well, in truth, I knew 

That thou, with all thy comrades lost, wouldst reach 

Thy country, but I dreaded to withstand 425 

My father's brother Neptune, who was* wroth, 

And fiercely wroth, for that thou hadst deprived 

His well-beloved son of sight. But now 

Attend, and I will show thee Ithaca 

By certain tokens ; mark them and believe. 430 

The port of Phorcys, Ancient of the Deep, 

Is here j and there the spreading olive-tree, 

Just at the haven's head ; and, close beside, 

The cool dark grotto, sacred to the nymphs 

Called Naiads, — a wide-vaulted cave where once 43s 

Thou earnest oft with chosen hecatombs, 

An offering to the nymphs, — and here thou seest 

The mountain Neritus with all his woods." 

So spake the goddess, and dispersed the mist, 
And all the scene appeared. Ulysses saw 44» 

Well pleased, rejoicing in his own dear land, 
And, stooping, kissed the bountiful earth, and raised 
His hands, and thus addressed the nymphs in 
prayer : — 

" Nymphs, Naiads, born to Jove, I did not hope 
To be with you again. With cheerful prayers us 
I now salute you. We shall bring you soon 
Our offerings, as of yore, if graciously 



Book XIII 17 

Jove's daughter, huntress-queen, shall grant me yet 
To live, and bless my well-beloved son." 

And then the goddess, blue-eyed Pallas, said : 450 
" Be of good cheer, and let no anxious thought 
Disturb thy mind. Let us bestir ourselves 
To hide away the treasures thou hast brought 
Within this hallowed grot in some recess 
Where they may lie in safety ; afterward 45? 

Will we take counsel what should next be done." 

The goddess said these words, and took her way 
Into the shadowy cavern, spying out 
Its hiding-places ; while Ulysses brought 
The treasures thither in his arms, — the gold, 460 
The enduring brass, the raiment nobly wrought, — 
Which the Phaeacians gave him. These they laid 
Together in due order ; Pallas then, 
The daughter of the ^Egis-bearer Jove, 
Closed up the opening with a massive rock. 465 

Then, sitting by the sacred olive-tree, 
They plotted to destroy the haughty crew 
Of suitors, and the blue-eyed Pallas said : — - 

" O nobly born, and versed in many wiles, 
Son of Laertes ! now the hour is come 47'. 

To think how thou shalt lay avenging hands 
Upon the shameless crew who, in thy house, 
For three years past have made themselves its lords, 
And wooed thy noble wife and brought her gifts, 
While, pining still for thy return, she gave 47? 

Hopes to each suitor, and by messages 

B 



1 8 The Odyssey. 

Made promises to all, though cherishing 
A different purpose in her secret heart." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her : 
" Ah me, I should have perished utterly, 480 

By such an evil fate as overtook 
Atrides Agamemnon, in the halls 
Of my own palace, but for thee, whose words, 
O goddess, have revealed what I should know. 
Now counsel me how I may be avenged. 435 

Be ever by my side, and strengthen me 
With courage, as thou didst when we o'erthrew 
The towery crest of Ilium. Would thou wert 
Still my ally, as then ! I would engage, 
O blue-eyed Pallas, with three hundred foes, 430 

If thou, dread goddess, wouldst but counsel me." 

And then the blue-eyed Pallas spake again : 
u I will be present with thee. When we once 
Begin the work, thou shalt not leave my sight ; 
And many a haughty suitor with his blood 495 

And brains shall stain thy spacious palace floor. 
Now will I change thine aspect, so that none 
Shall know thee. I will wither thy fair skin, 
And it shall hang on crooked limbs ; thy locks 
Of auburn I will cause to fall away, s* 

And round thee fling a cloak which all shall see 
With loathing. I will make thy lustrous eyes 
Dull to the sight, and thus shalt thou appear 
A squalid wretch to all the suitor train, 
And to thy wife, and to the son whom thou 30s 



Book XI I L 19 

Didst leave within thy palace. Then at first 

Repair thou to the herdsman, him who keeps 

Thy swine ; for he is loyal, and he loves 

Thy son and the discreet Penelope. 

There wilt thou find him as he tends his swine, s^ 

That find their pasturage beside the rock 

Of Corax, and by Arethusa's fount. 

On nourishing acorns they are fed, and drink 

The dark clear water, whence the flesh of swine 

Is fattened. There remain, and carefully 51- 

Inquire of all that thou wouldst know, while I, 

Taking my way to Sparta, the abode 

Of lovely women, call Telemachus, 

Thy son, Ulysses, who hath visited 

King Menelaus in his broad domain, s» 

To learn if haply thou art living yet." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her : 
" Why didst not thou, to whom all things are known, 
Tell him concerning me ? Must he too roam 
And suffer on the barren deep, and leave 5=5 

To others his estates, to be their spoil ? " 

And then the blue-eyed goddess spake again : 
" Let not that thought distress thee. It was I 
Who sent him thither, that he might deserve 
The praise of men. No evil meets him there ; ir- 
But in the halls of Atreus' son he sits, 
Safe mid the abounding luxuries. 'T is true 
That even now the suitors lie in wait, 
In their black ship, to slay him ere he reach 



20 The Odyssey. 

His native land ; but that will hardly be 535 

Before the earth shall cover many a one 

Of the proud suitors who consume thy wealth." 

So Pallas spake, and touched him with her wand, 
And caused the blooming skin to shrivel up 
On his slow limbs, and the fair hair to fall, 540 

And with an old man's wrinkles covered all 
His frame, and dimmed his lately glorious eyes. 
Another garb she gave, — a squalid vest ; 
A ragged, dirty cloak, all stained with smoke ; 
And over all the huge hide of a stag, 545 

From which the hair was worn. A staff, beside, 
She gave, and shabby scrip with many a rent, 
Tied with a twisted thong. This said and done, 
They parted ; and the goddess flew to seek 
Telemachus in Sparta's sacred town.
