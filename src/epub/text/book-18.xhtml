THERE came a common beggar, wont to ask 
Alms through the town of Ithaca, well known 
For greediness of stomach, gluttonous 
And a wine-bibber, but of little strength 
And courage, though he seemed of powerful mould, s 
Arnaeus was the name which at his birth 
His mother gave him, but the young men called 
The fellow Irus, for it was his wont 



Book XVIIL 115 

To go on errands, as a messenger, 

When he was ordered. Coming now, he thought a 

To drive Ulysses out of his own house, 

And railed at him, and said in winged words : — 

" Hence with thee ! leave the porch, old man, at 
once, 
Lest thou be taken by the foot and dragged 
Away from it. Dost thou not see how all 15 

Around us nod, to bid me drag thee out ? 
I am ashamed to do it. Rise and go, 
Else haply we may have a strife of blows." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, frowned and said : 
" Wretch ! there is nothing that I do or say *> 

To harm thee aught. I do not envy thee 
What others give thee, though the dole be large ; 
And ample is this threshold for us both. 
Nor shouldst thou envy others, for thou seemst 
A straggler like myself. The gods bestow 2- 

Wealth where they list. But do not challenge me 
To blows, lest, aged as I am, thou rouse 
My anger, and I make thy breast and lips 
Hideous with blood. To-morrow then will be 
A quiet day for me, since thou, I trust, 31 

In all the time to come, wilt never more 
Enter the palace of Laertes' son." 

The beggar Irus angrily rejoined : 
" Ye gods ! this glutton prattles volubly, 
Like an old woman at the chimney-side. 33 

Yet could I do him mischief, smiting him 






Ii6 The Odyssey. 

On both his sides, and dashing from his cheeks 
The teeth to earth, as men are wont to deal 
With swine that eat the wheat. Now gird thyself, 
Let these men see us fighting. How canst thou *» 
Think to contend with one so young as I ?" 

Thus fiercely did they wrangle as they stood 
Beside the polished threshold and before 
The lofty gates. The stout Antinotis heard, 
And, laughing heartily, bespake the rest : — 4s 

" Here, friends, is what we never yet have had. 
Behold the pleasant pastime which the gods 
Provide for us. These men — the stranger here, 
And Irus — quarrel, and will come to blows. 
Let us stand by and bring the combat on." 50 

He spake. All rose with laughter and came round 
The ragged beggars, w T hile Eupeithes' son, 
Antinous, in these words harangued the rest : — 

" Ye noble suitors, hear me. At the fire 
Already lie the paunches of two goats, 55 

Preparing for our evening meal, and both 
Are filled with fat and blood. Whoever shows 
Himself the better man in this affray, 
And conquers, he shall take the one of these 
He chooses, and shall ever afterward &> 

Feast at our table, and no man but he 
Shall ever come among us asking alms." 

He ended. All approved his words, and thus 
Ulysses, craftily dissembling, said : — 

" O friends, it is not well that one so old *s 



Book XVIII. 117 

As I, and broken by calamity, 

Should fight a younger man ; but hunger bids, 

And I may be o'ercome by blows. But now 

Swear all a solemn oath, that none of you, 

To favor Irus, wickedly will raise v 

His mighty hand to smite me, and so aid 

My adversary to my overthrow." 

He spake ; the suitor-train, assenting, took 
The oath, and when they all were duly sworn, 
The high-born prince Telemachus began : — 75 

il O stranger, if thy manly heart be moved 
To drive him hence, fear no one else of all 
The Achaians. Whosoever strikes at thee 
Has many to contend with. I am here 
The host. Antinoiis and Eurymachus, a> 

Wise men and kings, agree with me in this." 

He spake, and all approved. Ulysses drew 
And girt his tatters round his waist and showed 
His large and shapely thighs. Unclothed appeared 
His full broad shoulders, and his manly breast s s 
And sinewy arms. Minerva stood by him, 
And with a mighty breadth of limb endued 
The shepherd of the people. Earnestly 
The suitors gazed, and wondered at the sight, 
And each one, turning to his neighbor, said : — 9» 

" Irus, poor Irus, on himself has drawn 
An evil fate, for what a sinewy thigh 
His adversary shows beneath his rags ! " 

So talked they, while the heart of Irus sank 



Il8 The Odyssey. 

Within him ; yet the attendants girding him 95 

Forcibly drew him forward, sore afraid, 

The muscles quivering over every limb. 

&nd then Antinoiis spake, and chid him thus : — 

" Now, boaster, thou deservest not to live, 
Nay, nor to have been born, if thou dost fear 100 
And quake at meeting one so old as he, 
So broken with the hardships he has borne. 
And now I tell thee what will yet be done, 
Should he approve himself the better man, 
And conquer. I will have thee sent on board »s 
A galley to Epirus, and its king, 
The foe of all men living, Echetus, 
And he will pare away thy nose and ears 
With the sharp steel, and, wrenching out the parts 
Of shame, will cast them to be torn by dogs." ™ 

He spake, and Irus shook through all his frame 
With greater terror, yet they dragged him on 
Into the midst. Both champions lifted up 
Their arms. The godlike, much-enduring man, 
Ulysses, pondered whether so to strike «s 

His adversary that the breath of life 
Might leave him as he fell, or only smite 
To stretch him on the earth. As thus he mused, 
The lighter blow seemed wisest, lest the Greeks 
Should know who dealt it. When the hands of both 
Were thus uplifted, Irus gave a blow 121 

On his right shoulder, while Ulysses smote 
Irus beneath the ear, and broke the bone 



Book XVIII. 119 

Within, and brought the red blood from his mouth. 
He fell amid the dust, and shrieked and gnashed 125 
His teeth, and beat with jerking feet the ground. 
The suitor-train threw up their hands and laughed 
Till breathless, while Ulysses seized his feet 
And drew him o'er the threshold to the court 
And the porch doors, and there, beside the wall, 130 
Set him to lean against it, gave a staff 
Into his hands, and said in winged words : — 

" Sit there, and scare away the dogs and swine, 
But think not, wretched creature, to bear rule 
Over the stranger and the beggar tribe, 13s 

Or worse than this may happen to thee yet." 

He spake, and o'er his shoulders threw the scrip 
That yawned with chinks, and by a twisted thong 
Was fastened ; then he turned to take his seat 
Upon the threshold, while the suitor-train 140 

Went back into the palace with gay shouts 
Of laughter, and bespake him blandly thus : — 

" Stranger, may Jove and all the other gods 
Grant thee what thou desirest, and whate'er 
Is pleasant to thee ! Thou hast put an end us 

To this importunate beggar's rounds among 
The people. We shall send him off at once 
Into Epirus, and to Echetus, 
Its king, the foe of every living man." 

So talked the suitors, and the omen made *& 

Ulysses glad. Meantime Antinoiis placed 
The mighty paunch before the victor, filled 



1 20 The Odyssey. 

With blood and fat, and from the canister 
Amphinomus brought forth two loaves, and raised 
A golden cup and drank to him, and said : — 155 

" Hail, guest and father ! happy be thy days 
Henceforth, though dark with many sorrows now ! " 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : 
"Amphinomus, thou seemest most discreet, 
And such thy father is, of whom I hear tfo 

A worshipful report, the good and rich 
Dulichian Nisus. Thou, as I am told, 
Art son to him, and thou art seemingly 
A man of pertinent speech. I therefore say 
To thee, and bid thee hear and mark me well, tfs 
No being whom earth nourishes to breathe 
Her air and move upon her face is more 
The sport of circumstance than man. For while 
The gods give health, and he is strong of limb, 
He thinks no evil in the coming days 170 

Will overtake him. When the blessed gods 
Visit him with afflictions, these he bears 
Impatiently and with a fretful mind. 
Such is the mood of man, while yet he dwells 
On earth ; it changes as the All-Father gives 17s 
The sunshine or withholds it. I was once 
Peemed fortunate among my fellow-men, 
And many things that were unjust I did ; 
For in my strength and in my father's power, 
And valor of my brothers, I had put ** 

My trust. Let no man, therefore, dare to be 



Book XVIII. 121 

Unjust in aught, but tranquilly enjoy 
Whatever good the gods vouchsafe to give. 
Yet are these suitors guilty of foul wrong, 
Wasting the substance and dishonoring 185 

The wife of one who will not, as I deem, 
Remain long distant from his friends and home, 
But is already near. O, may some god 
Remove thee from this danger to thy home ! 
Nor mayst thou meet him when he shall return 190 
To his own land. For when he comes once more 
Beneath this roof, and finds the suitors here, 
Not without bloodshed will their parting be." 

He spake, and, pouring out a part, he drank 
The wine, and gave the goblet to the prince, 195 

Who crossed the hall, and sorrowfully shook 
His head, for now already did his heart 
Forebode the coming evil. Not by this 
Did he escape his death. Minerva laid 
A snare for him, that he might fall beneath, *» 

The strong arm of Telemachus. He went 
And took the seat from which he lately rose. 

Then blue-eyed Pallas moved Penelope, 
Sage daughter of Icarius, to appear 
Before the suitors, that their base intent 205 

Might be more fully seen, and she might win 
More honor from her husband and her son. 
Wherefore she forced a laugh, and thus began : — 

" Eurynome, I would at length appear, 
Though not till now, before the suitor-train, «« 

vol. 11. 6 



122 The Odyssey. 

Detested as they are. I there would speak 

A word of timely warning to my son, 

And give him counsel not to trust himself 

Too much among the suitors, who are fair 

In speech, but mean him foully in their hearts." a* 

Eurynome, the household matron, said : 
" Assuredly, my child, thou speakest well. 
Go now, and warn thy son, and keep back naught. 
First bathe, and, ere thou go, anoint thy cheeks, 
Nor show them stained with tears. It is not well 220 
To sorrow without end. For now thy son 
Is grown, and thou beholdest him at length 
What thou didst pray the gods, when he was born, 
That he might yet become, a bearded man." 

And then the sage Penelope rejoined : 225 

" Though anxious for my sake, persuade me not, 
Eurynome, to bathe, nor to anoint 
My cheeks with oil. The gods inhabiting 
Olympus took away their comeliness 
When in his roomy ships my husband sailed ; 230 
But bid Antinoe come, and call with her 
Hippodameia, that they both may stand 
Beside me in the hall. I will not go 
Alone among the men, for very shame." 

She spake, the aged dame went forth to bear 235 
The message, and to bring the women back. 
While blue-eyed Pallas had yet other cares, 
She brought a balmy sleep, and shed it o'er 
The daughter of Icarius, as she lay 



Book XVIII . 123 

Reclined upon her couch, her limbs relaxed 24c 

In rest. The glorious goddess gave a dower 

Of heavenly graces, that the Achaian chiefs 

Might look on her amazed. She lighted up 

Her fair face with a beauty all divine, 

Such as the queenly Cytherea wears 243 

When in the mazes of the dance she joins 

The Graces. Then she made her to the sight 

Of loftier stature and of statelier size, 

And fairer than the ivory newly carved. 

This having done, the gracious power withdrew, 230 

While from the palace came the white-armed maids, 

And prattled as they came. The balmy sleep 

Forsook their mistress at the sound. She passed 

Her hands across her cheeks, and thus she spake : — 

" 'T was a sweet sleep that, in my wretchedness, 255 
Wrapped me just now. Would that, this very hour, 
The chaste Diana by so soft a death 
Might end me, that my days might be no more 
Consumed in sorrow for a husband lost, 
Of peerless worth, the noblest of the Greeks." 260 

She spake, and from the royal bower went down, 
Yet not alone; two maidens went with her. 
And when that most august of womankind 
Drew near the suitors, at the door she stopped 
Of that magnificent hall, and o'er her cheeks *>$ 
Let fall the lustrous veil, while on each side 
A modest maiden stood. The suitors all 
Felt their knees tremble, and were sick with love, 



124 The Odyssey. 

And all desired her. Then the queen bespake 
Telemachus, her well-beloved son : — z-r 

" Telemachus, thy judgment is not firm, 
Nor dost thou think aright. While yet a boy 
Thy thought was wiser. Now that thou art grown, 
And on the verge of manhood, so that one 
Who comes from far and sees thy noble part 2 7S 

And stature well may say thou art the son 
Of a most fortunate father, yet to think 
And judge discreetly thou art not as then, 
For what a deed is this which has been done 
Even here ! Thou hast allowed a stranger guest 280 
To be assaulted rudely. How is this ? 
If one who sits a guest beneath our roof 
Be outraged thus, be sure it brings to thee 
Great shame and rank dishonor among men." 

To this discreet Telemachus replied : 285 

" Mother, I cannot take it ill that thou 
Shouldst be offended. But of many things 
I have a clear discernment, and can weigh 
The good and bad. I was till now a child, 
Yet even now I cannot always see 290 

The wiser course. These men bewilder me, 
As, sitting side by side, they lay their plots 
Against me, and I have no helper here. 
When Irus and the stranger fought, the strife 
Had no such issue as the suitors wished. 29s 

The stranger conquered. Would to Father Jove, 
To Pallas and Apollo, that the crew 



Book XVIII. 125 

Of suitors here might sit with nodding heads 

Struck down upon the spot, within these halls 

Or in the courts, and all with powerless limbs, 3<* 

As Irus sits beside the gate and nods, 

Like one o'ercome with wine, nor can he stand 

Upon his feet, nor go to where he dwells, 

If home he has, so feeble are his limbs." 

So talked the twain awhile ; then interposed 305 
Eurymachus, and thus bespake the queen : — 

" Sage daughter of Icarius ! if all those 
Who in Iasian Argos have their homes 
Should once behold thee, a still larger crowd 
Of suitors would to-morrow come and feast ya 

Within thy halls, so much dost thou excel 
In mind and form and face all womankind." 

To this the sage Penelope replied : 
" Eurymachus, the immortals took away 
Such grace of form and face as once was mine, 31s 
What time the sons of Argos sailed for Troy, 
And with them went Ulysses, my espoused. 
Should he return, and take again in charge 
My household, greater would my glory be, 
And prized more highly. I am wretched now, 320 
Such woes the gods have heaped upon my head. 
He, when he left his native island, grasped 
My right hand at the wrist, and said to me : 
1 Think not, dear wife, that all the well-armed Greeks 
Will come back safe from Troy. The Trojan men, 325 
They say, are brave in war, expert to cast 



126 The Odyssey. 

The spear and wing the arrow, skilled to rein 

The rapid steeds by which the bloody strife 

Of battle-fields is hurried to its close ; 

And therefore whether God will bring me back, 33* 

Or I shall fall in Troy, I cannot know. 

Take charge of all things here. I leave with thee 

My father and my mother in these halls. 

Be kind to them as now, nay, more than now, 

Since I shall not be here. When thou shalt see 335 

My son a bearded man, take to thyself 

A husband, whom thou wilt, and leave thy house.' 

Such were his words, and they have been fulfilled. 

The night will come in which I must endure 

This hateful marriage, wretched that I am, 3*» 

To whom the will of Jupiter forbids 

All consolation, and this bitter thought 

Weighs evermore upon my heart and soul. 

The custom was not thus in other times ; 

When suitors wooed a noble wife, the child 345 

Of some rich house, contending for her smile, 

They came with beeves and fatling sheep to feast 

The damsel's friends, and gave munificent gifts, 

But wasted not the wealth that was not theirs." 

She spake, Ulysses was rejoiced to see 35* 

That thus she sought to draw from each a gift, 
With fair and artful words. Yet were his thoughts 
Intent on other plans. Eupeithes' son, 
Antinoiis, thus made answer to the queen : — 

" Sage daughter of Icarius, only deign 355 



Book XVIII. 127 

To take the gifts which any of the Greeks 

Will bring, — nor is it gracious to reject 

A present, — yet be sure we go not hence, 

To our estates nor elsewhere, till thou make 

A bridegroom of the best Achaian here." 3*> 

So spake Antinoiis. All approved his words, 
And each sent forth a herald for his gift. 
The herald of Antinoiis brought to him 
A robe of many colors, beautiful 
And ample, with twelve golden clasps, which each 36s 
Had its well-fitted eye. Eurymachus 
Received a golden necklace, richly wrought, 
And set with amber beads, that glowed as if 
With sunshine. To Eurydamas there came 
A pair of ear-rings, each a triple gem, 370 

Daintily fashioned and of exquisite grace. 
Two servants bore them. From Pisander's house — 
Son of the Prince Polyctor — there was brought 
A collar of rare beauty. Thus did each 
Bestow a different yet becoming gift. 37: 

And then that most august of women went 
Back to the upper chambers with her maids, 
Who bore the sumptuous presents, while below 
The suitors turned them to the dance and song, 
Amused till evening came. Its darkness stole 380 
Over their pastime. Then they brought and placed 
Three hearths to light the palace, heaping them 
With wood, well dried and hard and newly cleft. 
With this they mingled flaming brands. The maids 



128 ' The Odyssey. 

Of the great sufferer, Ulysses, fed 385 

Tfce fire by turns. To them the hero spake : — 

" Ye maidens of a sovereign absent long, 
Withdraw to where your high-born mistress sits ; 
There turn the spindle, seeking to amuse 
Her lonely hours ; there comb with your own hands 
The fleece, and I will see that these have light. 391 
Even though they linger till the Morn is here 
In her bright car, they cannot overcome 
My patience. I am practised to endure." 

So spake he, and the maidens, as they heard, 395 
Cast at each other meaning looks, and laughed, 
And one Melantho, of the rosy cheeks, 
Railed at him impudently. She was born 
To Dolius, but Penelope had reared 
The damsel as a daughter of her own, «» 

And given her, for her pleasure, many things ; 
Yet for the sorrows of Penelope 
Melantho little cared. Eurymachus 
Had made the girl his paramour. She spake, 
And chid Ulysses with unmannerly words : — 405 

" Outlandish wretch ! thou must be one whose 
brain 
Is turned, since thou wilt neither go to sleep 
Within a smithy, nor in any place 
Of public shelter, but wilt stay and prate 
Among this company with no restraint 4* 

Or reverence. Either wine has stolen away 
Thy senses, or thy natural mood, perchance, 



Book XVIII. 



129 



Prompts thee to chatter idly. Art thou proud 
Of conquering Irus, that poor vagabond ? 
Beware lest some one of robuster arms v\ 

Than Irus seize and thrust thee out of doors 
With a bruised head and face begrimed with blood." 

The sage Ulysses frowned on her and said : 
" Impudent one, Telemachus shall hear 
From me the saucy words which thou hast said, *» 
And he will come and hew thee limb from limb." 

He spake ; the damsels, frightened at his words, 
Fled through the hall, and shook in every limb 
With terror, lest his threat should be fulfilled. 
He meantime stood beside the kindled hearths &s 
And fed the flames, and, looking on the crowd 
Of suitors, brooded in his secret heart 
O'er plans that would not fail to be fulfilled. 

But Pallas suffered not the suitors yet 
To cease from railing speeches, all the more 430 
To wound the spirit of Laertes' son. 
Eurymachus, the son of Polybus, 
Began to scoff at him, and thus he spake 
To wake the ready laughter of the rest : — 

" Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious queen. 43* 
I speak the thought that comes into my mind. 
Led by some god, no doubt, this man has come 
Into the palace ; for the light we have 
Of torches seems to issue from the crown 
Of his bald pate, a head without a hair." **> 

So said Eurymachus, and then bespake 
6* 1 



I30 The Odyssey. 

Ulysses, the destroyer of walled towns : — 

" Stranger, if I accept thee, wilt thou serve 
Upon the distant parts of my estate ? 
There shalt thou have fair wages, and shalt bring 44s 
The stones in heaps together, and shalt plant 
Tall trees, and I will feed thee through the year, 
And give thee clothes, and sandals for thy feet. 
But thou art used, no doubt, to idle ways, 
And never dost thou work with willing hands, w 
Bat dost prefer to roam the town and beg, 
Purveying for thy gluttonous appetite." 

Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus : — 
,f Eurymachus, if we were matched in work 
Against each other in the time of spring 455 

When days are long, and both were mowing grass, 
And I had a curved scythe in hand and thou 
Another, that we might keep up the strife 
Till nightfall, fasting, 'mid the abundant grass ; 
Or if there were a yoke of steers to drive, 460 

The sturdiest of their kind, sleek, large, well fed, 
Of equal age, and equal strength to bear 
The labor, and both strong, and if the field 
Were of four acres, with a. soil through which 
The plough could cleave its way, — then shouldst 
thou see 465 

How evenly my furrow would be turned. 
Or should the son of Saturn send to-day 
War from abroad, and I had but a shield, 
Two spears, and, fitted to my brows, a helm 






Book XVIII. 131 

Of brass, thou wouldst behold me pressing on 470 
Among the foremost warriors, and would see 
No cause to rail at my keen appetite. 
But arrogantly thou dost bear thyself, 
A.nd pitilessly; thou in thine own eyes 
Art great and mighty, since thou dost consort 47s 
With few, and those are not the best of men. 
Yet should Ulysses come to his own land, 
These gates that seem so wide would suddenly 
Become too narrow for thee in thy flight." 

He spake. Eurymachus grew yet more wroth, 4&> 
And frowned on him, and said in winged words : — 

"Wretch! I shall do thee mischief. Thou art 
bold, 
And babblest unabashed among us all. 
The wine, perhaps, is in thy foolish head, 
Or thou art always thus, and ever prone 4*s 

To prattle impudently. Art thou proud 
Of conquering Irus, that poor vagabond ? " 

Thus having said, he brandished in the air 
A footstool ; but Ulysses, to escape 
The anger of Eurymachus, sat down 490 

Before the knees of the Dulichian prince, 
Amphinomus. The footstool flew, and struck 
On the right arm the cupbearer. Down fell 
The beaker ringing ; he who bore it lay 
Stretched in the dust. Then in those shadowy halls 
The suitors rose in tumult. One of them 496 

Looked at another by his side, and said : — 



132 The Odyssey. 

" Would that this vagabond had met his death 
Ere he came hither. This confusion, then, 
Had never been. 'Tis for a beggar's sake s°« 

We wrangle, and the feast will henceforth give 
No pleasure ; we shall go from bad to worse." 

Then rose in majesty Telemachus, 
And said : " Ye are not in your senses sure, 
Unhappy men, who cannot eat and drink 505 

In peace. Some deity, no doubt, has moved 
Your minds to frenzy. Now, when each of you 
Has feasted well, let each withdraw to sleep, 
Just when he will. I drive no man away." 

He spake ; the suitors heard, and bit their lips, s» 
And wondered at Telemachus, who spake 
So resolutely. Then Amphinomus, 
The son of Nisus Aretiades, 
Stood forth, harangued the suitor-crowd, and said : — 

" O friends ! let no one here with carping words 515 
Seek to deny what is so justly said, 
Nor yet molest the stranger, nor do harm 
To any of the servants in the halls 
Of the great chief Ulysses. Now let him 
Who brings the guests their wine begin and fill s* 
The cups, that, pouring to the gods their part, 
We may withdraw to sleep. The stranger here 
Leave me within the palace, and in charge 
Of him to whom he came, Telemachus." 

He ended. All were pleased, and Mutlus then, 525 
Hero and herald from Dulichium's coast, 



Book XIX. 133 

And follower of the prince Amphinomus, 
Mingled a jar of wine, and went to each, 
Dispensing it. They to the blessed gods 
Poured first a part, and then they drank themselves 530 
The generous juice. And when the wine was poured, 
And they had drunk what each desired, they went 
Homeward to slumber, each in his abode.
